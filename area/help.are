0 "ARMOR CLASS" AC~
Armor Class is based on the AD&D idea that the lower ones AC is, the
less often they get hit.  Armor classes range from "barely armored"
to "armored like a tank".  In numeric terms, this is a range from 100
to -100.  If you are acquainted with AD&D, a 100 corresponds to a 10 AC,
and a -100 corresponds to a -10 AC.  Dexterity also affects how often
you get hit, the higher your dexterity (up to 18) the lower your natural
AC (your AC without any armor or spells on).  For every point of
dexterity above 15 (16+) your natural (100) AC is reduced by 10.  This
does not apply to monks.

0 "BOA ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"~
You may notice inconsistent use of "I" and "we" in this document. In
   general, "I" refers to Paul Phillips, who actually wrote Boa. On the
   other hand, "we" refers to shared opinions of Larry Doolittle, Charles
   Randall, Jon Nelson, and Paul Phillips, who have all actively
   developed pieces of this code. Larry Doolittle takes the blame for the
   current release. We are all grateful that Russ Nelson stepped forward
   to host a real net presence for Boa. Of course, Larry, Charles, and
   Jon wish to thank Paul for writing code that is worth maintaining and
   supporting.
   
   Paul Phillips records his acknowledgments as follows: Thanks to
   everyone in the WWW community, in general a great bunch of people.
   Special thanks to Clem Taylor <ctaylor@eecis.udel.edu>, who provided
   invaluable feedback on many of my ideas, and offered good ones of his
   own. Also thanks to John Franks, author of wn, for writing what I
   believe is the best webserver out there.

earth, having rebelled against their surface-dwelling brothers.  Duergar are
powerful, but lack a little in speed.  They can give and take punishment in

hurts their eyes extremely so. Generally drow have black colored skin and 
white hair.  Drow, like their surface dwelling cousins, are magical in nature.
They are also basically evil.  Drow elves are somewhat good spellcasters.

Damage       : Kills level 1 victim, does 1 damage otherwise.
Save         : Versus spell for half damage.
Minimum cost : 35 magic points

	Drains one level from a PC, or a mob.  When you lose levels, you also
lose max hit points, and practices.  Beware of monsters with level draining
ability. Also be aware that this spell makes you evil very quickly. This 
spell basically lowers the max hp of the victim and gives you the caster a
portion of experience. Cast on PCs, and you are not long for this world.

	(Due to popular demand, an explanation of the unusual properties of
energy drain follows...)

	When you cast energy drain, you are tying your soul, or your essence,
in other words, to the target.  The theory is, at this close contact, you
have the opportunity to suck the experience out of a creature.  Creature who
are immune to being drained (and to a lesser degree, those resistant) are
immune in the first place because they may be soulless parasites, blights 
upon the land, undead, REALLY powerful, etc. While attempting to drain 
levels, you may actually be exposing yourself.  These types of creatures 
will use the channel you have opened to suck *your* experience away.

	This spell causes the victim to become a moron if they fail their save.

	Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  program `Gnomovision' (a program to direct compilers to make passes
  at assemblers) written by James Hacker.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users
at the mercy of those companies.  By contrast, our General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  The
General Public License applies to the Free Software Foundation's
software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.
You can use it for your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make
sure that you have the freedom to give away or sell copies of free
software, that you receive source code or can get it if you want it,
that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The
"Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based
on the Program" means either the Program or any work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications.  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
other recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License
along with the Program.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy.

0 "GUILD SILVERSTONE"~
The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles
and perils of a cruel world. Each guild is heavily guarded (HA!), so that only
members may enter the building. Guilds are also the places where people come to

 the north section of Silverstone.

~

0 "HALF ELF" HALF-ELF "HALF ELVEN"~
This race calls no place home and strives for acceptance.  A Half elf 
can and does take on the qualities of both its human and elvish parents.
Half-elves have the magical powers of elves, and the strength and endurance of
a human, therefore.  Half-Elves can identify with either their elven or their
human ancestry, but in either case, tend to make better spellcasters than many 
humans.
~

0 "HALF GIANT" HALF-GIANT~
Race of half giant and half human, they look more human than anything
and can often be confused as a large human. Half-Giants are known for their
high strength and constitution.  As their great strength is evident to 
the naked eye, though, so is their lack of wit and wisdom. They are somewhat
sluggish, however.  It has been reported that the more intelligent members of
the species have become crusaders and trackers, as well as soldiers.
~

0 "HALF OGRE" HALF-OGRE~
This human/ogre crossbreed has many of the same characteristics as 
half giants, but they are a great deal hairier, and slightly less civilized,
and not quite as large.  Half ogres make fine warriors, since they generally
have great strength and high capacity for taking hits, but not much else. 
~

0 "HALF ORC" HALF-ORC~
Half human and half orc, this guy looks like a very very ugly human.
Not very sure where to live, these guys can be very dangerous or very helpful
(?) Though orcs hate humans, there are cases of cross-breeding between the
species (shudder. please.)  These offspring are tougher than most humans, but
have inherited the foul looks of their orcish parent.  Being shunned 
socially has forced many of them to turn to stealing their daily bread.
~

0 "HASTE"~
Usage        : cast 'haste' <victim>
Duration     : (caster's level) hours
Level        : 23 Mage, 23 Sorcerer

Level        : 23 Druid

returns movement points to their maximimum.

See Also: EAT
~

0 "HEROIC RESCUE"~
Usage : heroic

	This skill allows a paladin to rescue someone in combat in the room.
It is very similar to rescue, but a NAME field is not required. This means a
paladin can rescue anyone in his group simply by typing 'heroic' when a battle
begins.

See Also: RESCUE
~

0 "HOLY WORD"~
Usage        : cast 'holy word'
Duration     : Combat - unable to process commands for 2 rounds.
Level        : 36 Cleric
Minimum cost : 30 magic points

	This spell is room-wide, and has varying effects which depend on the 
experience level of whatever is in the room. It will kill puny things, 
paralyze not QUITE so puny things, blind things that are a little less 
puny, and just temporarily stun things that are any tougher.

	The catch? (You bet there's a catch...)

	'HOLY WORD' only affects mobiles in the room with EVIL alignment.

Save         : vs. spells for half.
Minimum Cost : 15 magic points

	This spell causes the caster to summon an intense blast of cold which

Usage        : cast 'identify' <object>
Duration     : Instant

Minimum Cost : 25 magic points

	This spell allows the caster to gain an intimate understanding of 
the properties of the object, from value to magical bonuses, from rent cost, 
to class restrictions.

	Optionally, purchasing a scroll of identify from Zifnab (or finding
one) is your best bet if you are lower level or not a magic user. A scroll 
does a few things that the spell does not : (1) it will enable you to see
some of the more important statistics of an yourself (just recite ident with 
no object specified) (2) incapacitate you for an hour.  The scrolls may also
be used on a monster or another player (sometimes there is little difference)
with much less of an effect (3) it still works on objects! bonus!

0 "MONK SKILLS"~
Monks are the well known masters of disaster. Generally VERY good at
hand-to-hand combat (i.e. going weaponless), kicking, and all manner of 
useful things. They can fall from great heights and not get hurt (much), and 
get right back up, and kick their opponent in the face after being knocked to 
the ground. Around level 30, you will at last be studly enough to use the 
secret of the quivering palm. Monks are also famous for their poverty, so 
monks can't use the bank (until they reach a high level) and they may also
rent out with only up to twenty or so items.

0 "NASTY RASH" HORATIO~
Usage        : cast 'nasty rash' <victim>
Duration     : Combat - unable to process commands for 2 rounds
Level        : 55 Cleric
Damage       : 500
Save         : Victim gets two saves, to take 1/10 damage PER SAVE
Minimum cost : 100 magic points

	Horatio discovered an interesting magic flux recently, and it hit big.
The gods quickly seized the technocery (Technological Sorcery) and made sure
that only the greatest clerics in their service would control its destructive
powers. This spell does 500 damage to a victim upon a successful touch attack.
If the victim saves twice, 5 measly damge. If the victim saves once, 50 damage.
If the poor sap has no magical defense, it's a goner. The spell actually causes
the victim to develope a rash so intense that it will tear itself apart to
relieve the pain, usually resulting in horrible death.

Tips for classes:
  Mages
   - Learn magic missile; it helps.
  Clerics
   - Avoid getting lower level versions of spells if you think you can get
   higher level versions of same spell. eg cure light / cure serious
  Druids
   - You MUST stay neutral so watch your alignment. And be sure to remind
     group leader when you are grouped.
   - Learn Tree Travel at 10th level, or else you won't be able to advance
     past 10th
   - Learn Flame Blade or else getting past 10th may prove very difficult.
  Rangers / Paladins
   - You must stay 'good' (rangers can be neutral) so watch your alignment.
  Psionists
   - VERY IMPORTANT !!! see - HELP PSITRAIN for information on how to gain.

Areas to explore:
  Silverstone -  Beagles at low levels and cats. The temple (north end of
                 town) is suitable for groups of low level characters.
  Malaria - A bit southeast of town, there's a tree. Certain kill-able things
            may exist in the town itself, as well. 'consider' is your friend.
  Chessboard -  In the city of silverstone.From Silverstone Guardian go n,
                run e, n e 3s w u.  Pawns and pigeons are easy.
  Spider Haunt Forest - South of Silverstone. You will need to explore a bit.
  Elven Forest - Good area for groups of level 1-9 players. From outside
                 the Hotel Royale head north to the crossroads then west down
                 main street till you enter the forest. Take the 2nd trail
                 leading north and then follow the leafy path.
  White Plume - Far to the west of Silverstone is the volcano white plume
                better be in a group of at least 5th level characters before
                you explore the mountain.
  Moria - North from crossroads east of Silverstone or southeast of Malaria.
          at least 5th level group. The monsters here are very aggressive
          toward strangers. (Take the coach to Arachnos then head north).
  Deadhame - In the graveyard. (Ask someone for directions)
  Shire - Youths are good for levels 2-3+. Located to the west of Silverstone's
          North Crossroads, or take the coach.
  Beneath the Monks Guild -  Lots of useful potions here, good for groups of  
                             level 2-3+. West and North from shire.

Other Tips:
 - Don't use identify scrolls just anywhere. You may become stunned and be
   attacked ... find a safe room first.
 - It's often easier to replace lost equipment than lost experience. Dont
go racing back to retrieve your equip untill healed. You will probably just
   be killed again.

require a sacrifice of 25,000 coins for mobs and 75,000 coins for PC's, and the
beneficiary loses 1 con point permanently..after the con reaches 3, no more
resurrections can occur. The calling of such help from a deity is so draining
on the cleric that the cleric will move to 1 hit point, 1 mana, and 1 movement
point, also they will be stunned for a while.  Make sure you are in a safe place
before casting or else you might end up with the same fate as your victim.  If
this spell is cast upon a monster the monster becomes a loyal follower of the
cast for 36 game hours. Note : this spell will ALSO negate the xp hole, and
restores the victim to full hp, mana, and moves. (for when they next awaken)

IMPORTANT:  The dead character has to stay OUT of the game until he/she is
	resurrected.  If he/she reenters the game, he/she cannot be resurrected.

.                MOVING THROUGHOUT GAME:
                ---------------------------
The game divided into many rooms which are connected by various
directionals to make up areas.  When you are in a room, you can
find the exits in the room by typing EXITS.  Autoexit is a helpful
command to initiate (type CONFIG +AUTOEXIT), because it will
automatically show you what exits there are in the room.  Be warned
however, you will only see the obvious exits.  You must pay attention
to the room descriptions to see if there might be any doors or hidden
passages in the room. 

Directional commands: (in parentheses you find the shorthand)
NORTH (n)    SOUTH (s)    EAST (e)    WEST (w)     UP (u)     DOWN (d)
NORTHEAST (Ne)  NORTHWEST (Nw)  SOUTHEAST (Se)  SOUTHWEST (Sw)
 
Note:  You will notice that in the prompt <20hp 10bp 20mv>, the 'mv'
       refers to your movement points.  If your movement points were
       to run out, you will be unable to move between rooms due to 
       exhaustion.  If you type SLEEP or REST your movement points will
       slowly be replenished.  You must type STAND or WAKE before 
       walking again.

0 AARAKOCRA~
This race of intelligent birdmen ordinarily live isolated and are
peaceful beings.  However, something happened to change that, and they now
reside with the 'evil' races of Malaria.  They have a wing span of about
twenty feet and they stand about five feet tall.  Their feet resemble
those of birds, and they all have beaks.  Red, orange & yellow males have
been seen; the females are brown and grey.  The bones of the Aarakocra are
hollow (as birds), which makes them very fragile beings.

	They are adept in the magical arts as well as thievery.  Their
powerful wings and magical essence allow for the Aarakocra to be
constantly in flight.

~

53 AASSIGN~
Syntax: aassign <filename>.are  Example:  aassign edo.are
 
AASSIGN temporarily assigns all rooms, objects, and mobiles in the area
range to your pfile.  This allows you to use rlist, olist, mlist, and
reset list.  This also means that typing savearea, reset area, or 
instazone will affect this area.  
 
To save changes permenantly, type "aassign none" and foldarea.
 
Warning!! Do not have an area aassigned to yourself when getting personal
vnums assigned to you.  The personal vnums will overwrite the area file.
 
In order to assign a proto area to yourself, you must either have that
area bestowed to you or you must be Greater God+.
 
In order to assign a nonproto area to yourself, you must either have
that area bestowed to you by a member of the Area Council or you must
be Exalted+. Even if you have the area bestowed to you, only Lesser+
can assign themselves nonproto areas.

1 'ACETUM PRIMUS'~
'Acetum Primus,' is the third and most powerful of the known acid
disciplines at the Mage's disposal.  This incantation pulls forth the
strongest caustic agents in the casting Mage's neighboring planes,
and propels them in a tight cyclone-like blast towards the Mage's
chosen victim.  The cross-dimensional disturbance, the physical
violence, and the bonescouring potency of the conjured compound all
work together to effect an estimable estrapade.
 
~

1 'ACID BLAST' 'BURNING HANDS' 'COLOUR SPRAY' FIREBALL 'LIGHTNING BOLT'
  'MAGIC MISSILE' 'SHOCKING GRASP'~
These are all attack spells and should not be used against another player

including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
Gas breath is an area attack, the other breath spells are not.

0 ACRO~
Usage: acro

Acro is the game of acronyms.  The game starts when three or more players
join. To join simply type 'acro'.  You can also type 'acro' at any time
during the game to see the game status, or 'acro scores' to see the
scores.

The computer starts a new round by giving all players an acronym, such as:
TWINE

Each player must expand this acronym into a matching phrase and submit it like:
acro the world is not enough

When each player submits an entry, or time runs out the game then displays
all the submitted acros like:
1.  the world is not enough
2.  tim waits in new england
3.  twenty winners in nine entries

You vote for an entry by typing: acro #, like:
acro 1

When everybody has voted or time runs out, the winner is announced and is
given a point.  The game then moves on to a new acronym and another round.

If you want to quit the same, type: acro quit

0 ADVANCE~

advance him one level. A level 0 player (Man/Woman) is always only advanced by
one level.

~

53 ADVANCEDEXITS~
SMAUG supports having more than one exit in the same direction,
as well as the special direction 'somewhere', represented by a '?'.
 
If you already have an exit leading north, and would like another one,
use a plus sign '+' in front of the direction:
rset exit +n 3001          - Adds another exit north to room 3001
 
To modify an extra exit like this, or to remove it, you'll have to
refer to it by number:
rset exit #2 3002          - Change the second exit to go to room 3002
 
To know what number an exit is, do an "rstat".
 
For someone to be able to use the second north exit, you have to set one
of the extra flags (see EXFLAGS) like CAN_CLIMB.  It is also usually a good
idea to set the HIDDEN flag for any special exit so that it looks nicer
with autoexits on.
 
The AUTO flag makes it possible to go in a direction by simply typing the
keyword for that exit:
rset exit ? 3001           - Create a 'somewhere' exit to 3001
rset exflags ? auto hidden - Set the proper flags
rset exname ? swim         - Set the keyword "swim"
If a player types 'swim' in the room, they will move to room 3001.

0 AFFECTED 'AFFECTED BY'~
Syntax:  affected       (abbrevation:  af)
Syntax:  affected by    (abbreviation: af by)
 
'Affected' is a spells-at-a-glance function, which displays only the spells
(and skill affects) your character is currently under.  Each affect will be
listed by name only for the sake of brevity (if you want to know what each
is doing, use help <spell/skill name> or 'score').
 
Characters level 20 or above and deadly characters will also see the number
of rounds remaining for each affect.  Affects with a remaining lifespan of
less than 25 rounds are displayed in white, and those in immediate danger
of wearing off will flash.
 
'Affected by' displays a character's affects separate from its spell/skill
affect list.  This is useful for ensuring that affects given from equipment
are actually functioning.  For example, if you are wearing a visor with
detect_invis but 'affected by' does not show you as having that affect, you
are not detecting invisibility.
 
'Affected by' also displays your current susceptibilities, resistances and
immunities if your character is level 20 or higher.

53 AFFECTEDBY~
The following are affect flags that can be used when osetting an item
(with oset <item> affect affected <affect flag>).  These flags can also

Syntax:  ban   <site>
Syntax:  ban
Syntax:  ban <# of ban on ban list> level <level of char to ban and below>
 
BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.
 
BAN with no arguments returns an enumerated list of banned sites.
 
To set a specific level of character to ban from a site, use 'ban' to get
the list number of the banned site and then use 'ban level'.
Example:  ban 2 level 10
 
This will ban all characters level 10 and under from the second site on
the 'ban' list.
 
ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list.
 
The site ban test works by suffix comparison, so if you ban 'foo.edu',
all sites within 'foo.edu' are banned as well.

0 AMAZON~
.  Legend tells of an island sanctuary that lies deep within the
hostile jungles of Lustria.  This island is rumored to be home of a
race of ferocious female warriors.  These warriors have been named
Amazons, after the river on which the island lies.
   The Amazon race was born when the females of the Norse colony of
Skeggi, founded in Lustria, were forced to leave their homes.  Large
numbers of male warriors deserted Skeggi, impatient to explore and
discover the vast wealth of the Lizardman Empire.  When these warriors
did not return it was left to their wives to defend the settlement of
Skeggi.  These new 'warrior women' were looked upon with suspicious eyes
by the male populace.  After an unsuccessful attack by a Lizardman
cohort, the males saw the women's job as defenders being complete.
They were not accepted by the male dominated Norse warrior society
which holds that 'battle is man's work and not woman's'.  The women
however, had a different idea.  Not willing to put away their weapons
and go back caring for the men, they decided to leave the settlement.
   Sailing on a longship along the coast and up the estuary of a great
river the Valkyries finally settled in a swampy island in the middle of
the river, surrounded on all sides by the impenetrable jungle.  The
island contained deserted ruins of Lizardman temples and this became
the Valkyries stronghold.

level-you-should-be-to-be-margianlly-succesful-in-killing-things-in-the-area
are also provided.

 NOTE!!!!!!!!
     The numbers are ROUGH!  And just because an area is advertised
for X level does not necessarily mean that X level can wipe out the area!!!
Use COMMON SENSE.  ASK people about the areas, find experienced people to
group with.  Don't get cocky, and you'll live longer.   Be social, and you
will live longer.  Ask questions, and you will live longer.

P.S. if anyone feels the numbers are wildly inaccurate, post a message.

 AREAS ALL : Shows you all areas, regardless of level.

0 ASSIST~
Usage : assist <friend>

	If you type "assist <player>" you will begin fighting the same person
the <player> is.

	ASSIST is similar to RESCUE except the <player> continues fighting 
(and being beat upon!). It is better than KILL in many cases because you do 
not have to choose between 1.golem and 2.golem (or 1.lamia that just entered
the room). Even though monsters of the same type assist each other in combat,
ASSIST is better because you will eliminate one aggressor much faster. Note
that you can assist NPCs, too, should need be.

gold.

Auction bid <value> will place a bet for the item, and 
auction stop (immortals only) will stop an auction in progress. 

Special thanks to Erwin Andreasen for writing this function.
(Ported here from a publicly available source.)

At the present, if the mud crashes in mid auction, you will lose both 
your bidded money and the item.  This will soon be fixed.
 
You are able to see auction almost from the point of character creation,
however, you cannot USE auction until level THREE or higher.  To remove
the auction channel from your screen, type CHANNEL -AUCTION.

have a chance of backfiring if the character using them is much lower in
level than the spell level on the item.
 
For example, a level 15 character trying to invoke a wand with level 50
fireball may injure themselves when the spell backfires.
 
~

0 BACKSTAB~
Usage : backstab <victim>
 
	This skill, which is thief only, is a way to sneak up on a person, and 
attempt to place your dagger in his back, at exactly the point where it does
the most damage. A successful backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on
level. Also, the chance of successfully backstabbing your enemy depends on how
well you have practiced backstab at your guild, and how much you've learned
since then. You cannot backstab an enemy you are already fighting.
~

0 BACKSTAB BS DISARM KICK KILL MURDER~
Syntax: backstab <character>
Syntax: disarm
Syntax: kick
Syntax: kill     <character>
Syntax: murder   <character>

KILL starts a fight, and, hopefully, kills something.  BACKSTAB is another way
to start a fight, used by thieves.  BS is a synonym for BACKSTAB.

MURDER is used to kill other player characters.  There are restrictions on
murdering low level players, and there are penalties for using MURDER.

DISARM is an auxiliary fighting command to disarm your opponent.  Similarly,
KICK will inflict more damage during combat by kicking.

In order to BACKSTAB, DISARM, or KICK successfully, you must practice
the appropriate skill.

~

0 BARBARIAN SAVAGE~
Barbarians are known to have more strength than the average player. This
makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat, as they possess skills of violence
and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class. However, they lack
the ability to use magic of any sort. This warrior class can fight uniquely,
in that possessed with the berserker skill, the barbarian fights wildly with
inhuman strength.

        You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the barbarian's guild with the guildmaster (usually the last room)

See Also: PRACTICE
~

65 BARKSKIN~
Syntax: cast 'barkskin' <victim>
Level : Druid 3    Ranger 15
 
When this spell is cast upon a victim who is not already affected by this
spell, the victim's skin turns hard and bark like.  This effectively reduces
their armor class by 10 points.  It also improves their saving throw by 1,
versus spell.
 
~

0 BASH~
Usage : bash <victim>
Damage : 2

	The success of a bash depends upon how well you have learned how. To
bash someone is to attempt to knock that person over. If you succeed you will
inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear. The victim will
be unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of violence. If you miss, you lose
your balance and fall. After you bash, *you* are also unable to process 
commands for 2 rounds. Note that hitting a person who is sitting (bashed)
will inflict 1.5*damage.

See Also: RESCUE, KICK
~

0 BELLOW~
Usage : bellow

	Bellow is a loud war cry used in battle. To use this skill simply type
bellow and let'er rip. If you properly shout your battle cries you might
inspire fear in your enemies, or even stun them briefly. This skill is a
area effect skill and if someone in the same room is not in your group they
WILL be effected.

See Also: WARCRY
~

0 BERSERK~
Usage : berserk 

	This is a skill used by Barbarians. When a barbarian attempts to go
berserk he forces his mind to use all his strength and adrenaline in battle.
Once he goes berserk he cannot think of anything besides combat (i.e. can't
flee). The good thing about this is when they do go berserk they get special
bonuses to damage, however since the barbarian is not in his right mind, he
might not hit as well. This skill only usable while fighting.

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~

Syntax:  quaff  <potion>                (to quaff potions)

Syntax:  recite <scroll> <target>       (to recite a scroll)
Syntax:  zap    <target>                (to use a wand on a target)
 
BRANDISH invokes a magical staff.
 
QUAFF quaffs a potion (as opposed to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).
 
RECITE recites a magical scroll; the <target> is optional, depending on the
nature of the scroll.

you are fighting someone, then that character is used for a target.
 
You must be holding a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

See EAT, BACKFIRE, RECHARGE
~

0 BREATH~
The breath command allows you to use a breath weapon on another monster.
The only way to get a breath weapon is to either be a monster with such an
ability (dragons usually have one) or quaff a potion of fire/ice/acid/gas/
lightning breath.

	If you are already fighting, breath without any arguments will breath on
the monster you are fighting.  If you are NOT fighting you must supply the name
of a target to breath on.

	Breath weapons are terrifying and most opponents will flee before
you get a chance to breath on them.  However, you may blast bystanders
with the same breath.
 
	This means breath weapons are not terribly accurate.  You will always
hit the monster you target and will usually hit his group, followers and his
leader.  You will also probably blast anyone currently hitting on you.  You also
have a small chance (less than half) of hitting each bystander (someone not
covered above).  They will not appreciate this and will probably decide to beat
the snot out of you.

	When quaffed breath potions modify you so that you can breath ONE time.
If you do not breath in 2-3 rounds the potion will explode inside you causing
half of its normal damage. These potions also reduce your CON for the duration
of the spell.  You therefore cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you
have constitution.  You also cannot quaff more breath weapon levels than you
have levels.

	The damage of a breath weapon is a function of its level, your level,
and your hitpoints.  If your level is equal to the breath weapon's level it will
do your hitpoints worth of damage to the target.  If your level is double the
level of the breath weapon it will only do half your hitpoints of damage.
Monsters natural breath weapons exceed the CON restriction and even a 50th level
monster can do full damage.  Since most huge monsters have huge hitpoints, this
can be a LOT of damage. Do not ever fight a titanium dragon.

~

0 BREW~
Usage : brew <potion>

	You'll have to look for the recipies and even the NAMES of brews 
to make... Once you know how to make a brew, you need only collect the items,
and successfully apply your brew skill. (yes, you have to practice it, first)

example of what a recipe might look like :

     To make the brew of antidote, two things dost thou require :
     serpent's poison and fertilizer, to bind to your desire.

You go off and find these items, then enter :

brew antidote

Voila. You are now the proud owner of something handy.

Collect them all! (not sold in stores, offer void where prohibited)
~

0 BRIEF~
Usage : brief

	Toggle "brief mode". When in brief mode, you do not see the
descriptions of the room you are in; only the name of the room, and the people
and objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the area in which you
travel, however, it is not advisable to use this command. Frequently, you will
find small, but vital hints in the descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at
your surroundings could mean the difference between life and death!

0 CHANNEL~
A little note about channels and proper use of them.

OOC is for topics not related to the game-play of the MUD, this includes
what you ate for lunch or things that may be related to the mud but are
out of character like how did An code such-and-such.  OOC is also for
stuff that you see in INFO's, like deaths of other players.

SHOUT, GOSSIP, and AUCTION are all in-character channels.  This means that
you can't use them for stuff relating to things non-MUD.  AUCTION is not
to be used in place of SHOUT.

SAY and TELL (and variants of tell) are considered to be both in and out
of character, this means you can use them to say whatever you want.

~

1 CHANNELS~
Syntax: channels
Syntax: channels +<channel|all>
Syntax: channels -<channel|all>
 
With no options, CHANNELS show you your current channels.  With a plus
or minus sign and an option, CHANNELS turns that channel on or off.  With
all as the option, CHANNELS will turn on/off all normal channels
 
The first channels you will have available as a new player are SAY, TELL,
and NEWBIE.  To use say, the person you want to talk to must be in the same
room, just type SAY <message>.  To use tell, the target person may be
anywhere, just type TELL <name or 0.name> [message].

Newbiechat is seen and used by only level 1 characters and the Immortals

1 CHARISMA CHA~
Charisma (CHA in your 'score') represents your characters physical beauty

No class receives charisma as a prime attribute.
~

1 'CHARM' 'CHARM PERSON'~
The charm spell, if successful, will place the victim (only mobs, attempts
to charm other player-characters may incur the wrath of the gods) under
your control for the duration of the spell.  While under your control
the creature is your servant, and may assist you in combat and other
more minor duties.  Use the 'order' command to give them orders.
 
Aggressive mobs will lose their aggressiveness while charmed, but will
immediately return to their violent ways when the spell wears off.
~

0 CHAT . MUSIC ASK ANSWER SHOUT YELL~
Syntax: chat     <message>
Syntax: music    <message>
Syntax: ask      <message>
Syntax: answer   <message>
Syntax: shout    <message>
Syntax: yell     <message>

These commands send messages through communication channels to other players.

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

CHAT, MUSIC, and QUESTION and ANSWER also send messages to all interested 
players.  '.' is a synonym for CHAT.  The ASK and ANSWER commands 
both use the same 'question' channel

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

You can use the CHANNELS command to hear, or not hear, any of these channels.

someone's prototype area, and no vnum within the specified range is
a part of a live (non-prototype) area, there will be no result from
this command and the vnums are safe to assign.  If any vnum in the

~

0 CLAN CLANS~
Usage : clan

        Clans are groups of people that share a common interest, and do 
not fear being killed by players of differing interests.  These people form
clans, which are more permanent versions of groups.  Clans can use the
command CTELL to communicate with other clan members anywhere in the world.

	Typing CLAN with no parameters will show you the people in your clan,
and their titles (i.e., clan leader, clan armorer, etc.)

	The leader of a clan can 'induct <name>' to include somebody in their
clan, they can also 'dismiss <name>' to remove somebody.  WARNING : Only the
clan leader can dismiss, and you can't leave a clan unless you are dismissed.

'clan ok' will allow somebody to include you in their clan.

	Clan members must all be on the same side of the race war.  If they 
are not, then fighting in clan wars will be extremely hard, if not impossible.
Therefore clans will be restricted to one side of the race war, you can see
what races are on which side in the RACE WAR help section.  When you are in
a clan, you will be able to kill anybody in other clans, no matter if you
have enabled RACE WAR or not.  No level restrictions, no race restrictions,
clan members are pkillers!  Clan wars in the arena are somewhat different,
since good and evil members start out on opposite sides of the arena, the
good clans should band together and evil should band together to defeat the
other side.  Once one side is gone, then the clans can fight among themselves
and the last clan standing wins.  In normal arenas, free for all applies,  
but it is suggested that you stick to killing the opposite race from your-
self.

	Every character is restricted to one clan at a time.  Players may join
as many clans as they want with different characters, BUT be warned the clan
leader will be able to find out of you are a spy from another clan.

affected by the spell will have lower damage class (compare WARP WEAPON).

1 DEADLY~
A "Deadly" character is one who shows up under the Deadly Characters portion
of the Who list (type 'who deadly' to see a list deadly characters online).
Your character will be deadly if you choose the path of the pkillers when

until your name shows up on 'who deadly'.
~

1 'DEADLY CLANS~
Clans are societies composed of a group of players which have joined 
together under a common cause.  If you are a member of a clan you have
the ability to pkill other deadly players outside of your own clan.
Depending on the clan you join, you may be asked  to follow set of
rules dictated by the clan's leaders.

the character is outcasted it remains deadly.

0 DEATH~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the starting point
of the game.  If you have 'rented' at least once, this will be the Lobby
or Inn in your Hometown or last place you rented.  Your corpse is left
behind where you were killed, together with all of your equipment. This
includes the gold you were carrying.
 
Corpses decay after time, or scavengers may eat your corpse, and other
scavengers may loot your equipment.
 
You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is proportional
to the level you are at and is subtracted from the current exp when killed.
 
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real
time).  Only the player who died or someone the player 'allows' to help
may retrieve objects from a player's corpse.

~

1 DEXTERITY DEX~
Dexterity (DEX in your 'score') represents your character's agility, and
it affects (among other things):
 
 - the maximum number of items you can carry at once in your inventory;
   with each additional point of dex you can carry additional items.
 
 - each additional point of dexterity also lowers (improves) your natural
   armor class.
 
 - the number of new moves you receive each time you level, as well as the
   number of moves you regenerate at each tick (when resting to refresh or
   regain movement points).
 
 - success chances with bash and stun, and helps determine whether a thief
   will be able to poison a weapon.
 
Dexterity is also very important for quaffing potions in combat.  High dex
will allow you to quaff without dropping many potions during the heat of
battle, while a poor dexterity will cause you to accidentally drop many
of the valuable vials.
 
Dexterity is the prime attribute of thieves and vampires.
~

You can dig and bury items through the use of the dig skill and bury command.
Buried items are not visible to players, even through the use of spells such
as locate object.  To dig an item up, type dig with no arguments.  Having a
shovel raises your chance of success.  If you dig in a direction, you will
attempt to dig open an exit.
 
To bury an item (or corpse), drop the item on the ground and bury <item>.
Depending on the size and weight of the object, you might need a shovel.
 
* Note:  Deadly players can bury/dig up each other's corpses. *
 
Items buried will not last beyond crash or reboot.  Do not attempt to use
this skill for storage of items you wish to keep.

-1 DIKU~
Realms of Despair was originally based on the Merc 2.1 code which was
              based on the orignal DIKUMud code created by:

                       The Original DIKUMud Team:

          Katja Nyboe               [Superwoman] (katz@freja.diku.dk)
          Tom Madsen              [Stormbringer] (noop@freja.diku.dk)
          Hans Henrik Staerfeldt           [God] (bombman@freja.diku.dk)
          Michael Seifert                 [Papi] (seifert@freja.diku.dk)
          Sebastian Hammer               [Quinn] (quinn@freja.diku.dk)

                     Additional contributions from:

 Michael Curran  - the player title collection and additional locations.
 Bill Wisner     - for being the first to successfully port the game,
                   uncovering several old bugs, uh, inconsistencies,
                   in the process.

         And: Mads Haar and Stephan Dahl for additional locations.

  The Original DIKUMud was Developed at the Department of Computer Science
                     at the University of Copenhagen.
~

0 DISARM~
There are two kinds of disarm.  Disarming weapons and disarming traps.

	If one types "disarm monstername", then, if the player has the disarm
weapon skill, and successfully uses it, the monster's weapon will fly from
its hand/tentacle, etc.   

	If one types "disarm trapname", if the player has the disarm traps
skill, one can attempt to disable the trap.. failure indicates a high
probability that the trap will be sprung on the player attempting the disarm.

See Also: FIND TRAPS
~

0 DISGUISE~
Usage : disguise
 
	Disguise is a skill that allows thieves to disguise themselves. "What
does this mean!" Well, this won't do squat against PC's, but those pesky mobs
that hate you and fear you will forget who you are, if you disguise yourself
well. This is a learnable skill.

	This spell summons a green beam of destructive power that can
disintegrate molecules on contact. This beam will also destroy equipment!

take a full blast of damage and the equipment they are using must SAVE or be
destroyed.

See Also: PSIONIC DISINTEGRATION
~

0 'DISPEL EVIL'~
Syntax: cast 'dispel evil' <victim>
 
This spell invokes the wrath of the gods upon an evil victim.  If you do

~

0 'DISPEL MAGIC'~
Syntax:  cast 'dispel magic' <character>
 
This spell dispels magical affects on a character.  It may be used as
an offensive spell to remove an enemy's magical advantages, or as a
benign spell to remove one's own magical handicaps.
 
WARNING:  dispel magic is an offensive spell when cast on anyone other
than yourself, and will possibly begin a battle with the victim.
 
* DO NOT cast dispel magic on another player character unless you both
appear under the 'deadly characters' section of the who list!
~

0 DISPLAY~
Usage : display <"0" or "1">
 
	Display allows you to change your term setup on the mud, allowing you to
have an info-bar on the bottom of your screen.  The info-bar contains your hit
points, mana, movement points, gold on hand, and experience points. Your prompt
is changed to the '>' symbol. When you return to display 0 your old prompt will
be restored.
 
	Currently, display uses VT100 term setups.  To turn display onto VT100,
use the "1" option.  To turn off the VT100 display, use the "0" option. The
VT100 display uses the value given after the resize command to determine where
to put the status bar. If the status bar is cut off or is located in the middle
of your screen, try using resize.

See Also: RESIZE
~

1 DISRUPTION~
With the spell 'Disruption,' the casting Mage causes his opponent to
be enveloped in a weird energy field that momentarily alters the plane
which the victim inhabits.  The spell was an early attempt by the Dark
Mage Thanatos to cause teleportation, but it was a failed attempt.  
Instead of teleporting it causes a horrendous nerve-wracking pain as
the victim exits and reenters his current plane of existence.

damage, but every little bit helps. Each time you are hit, the game checks your
dodge skill, which does not improve with use, only with practice. If you make
it, the damage is reduced by 1-3 points. Dodge only helps against physical
attacks.

0 DRUID~
The druid is a lover and protector of the natural land.  Be it the forests
full of centaurs and deer, the streams full of fish, or the bug-infested
swamps, a druid always strives to protect and preserve nature.  Wielding
mighty spells from the gods themselves, druids strive hard at their work.
 
Strong in wisdom, with a body trained to near perfection by their rugged
lifestyle, a druid has many disciplines upon which to draw.  From powerful
spells of healing which can bring the near dead back to full vigor, to the
ability to mystically create water and food, to the awesome power of nature
which they command in battle via spells able to quake the land and split
the sky, druids demonstrate that mastery of magic is not just a hobby, but
a way of life for them.  Able to face many warriors on almost even footing,
and able to shield themselves nearly as well as some mages, druids are
truly a gifted class.

~

0 DWARF~
Wide as a barrel and about as tall. This short stalky race builds
the best stone houses/tunnels or anything made of stone around. Dwarves are
known to have very good constitution, but as also known to be very hard to
get along with. If a dwarf does not have a beard a foot long he must be a
baby.  They are not always as fast on their feet as some races, but make 
excellent warriors nonetheless.  They are also somewhat religious types, 
and the call of the priest's cloth is strong within them.
~

0 DWARF DWARVES DWARFS DWARVEN~
Dwarves are relatively short (in Human terms), stocky and powerfully-built
creatures.  Long-lived and extremely sturdy, they are known equally as well
for their hardiness as for their cantankerous personalities.  Their thick,
stout frames lend them poor dexterity, but high strength and stamina.  This
race has produced some of the most reknowned fighters.  Dwarves possess the
inherent ability to see in the dark with infravision.
 
Dwarves average from four foot five inches and five feet tall, with dusky
complexions and thick, fur-covered torsos and limbs.  Both men and women
proudly wear and take pride in their beards.

         eat   <object> <container>      (eat directly from a container)
 
Drink instructs your character to drink from a fountain or a drink container
to alleviate thirst.
 
Eat instructs your character to eat an item of food or a magical pill (which
function in a similar fashion as potions); pills do not fill stomach space.
 
When you are hungry or thirsty (you will see messages at each tick that
tell you if you are starving or dying of thirst, and can check your
current state with either 'score' or 'oldscore'), you will not regain
hitpoints, movement points or mana back as rapidly as if you were well
fed and hydrated.
 
If you stay hungry or thirsty too long and you are not an Avatar, your
mental state will begin to suffer.  Your combat skills will be affected,
your coordination will suffer and you may begin to either hallucinate or
become depressed.  Eating, drinking and a little rest will solve this
problem after a short period of time.

~

51 ECONOMY~
Each area will initialize (on bootup of the mud) with a pool of gold based
on the area's range and the wealth of each mob in that area.
 
The shopkeepers and thieves will automatically deposit gold into the economy
if they are carrying more than a certain amount (the higher the level of the
shopkeeper, the greater they will carry before depositing).
 
To allow mobprogs to be created to manipulate area economies, making them
interactive and interdependent, there are two mpcommands:  mpdeposit, and
mpwithdraw (see related helpfiles).  There is also an 'if economy' ifcheck.
 
The aset command can also be used to adjust an area's economy by hand
(example:  aset <area filename> low_economy <amount>, this will give
the specified area a minimum economy at the level you set).
 
Mobs will not repop with more gold than what they were originally created
with, but if the area economy runs low they will begin to repop with less
until the economy is replenished (as they all share the same gold pool).
 
Use foldarea to make changes to an area's economy with aset permenent.

0 'ELDRITCH SPHERE'~

attacks.
~

0 ELF ELVES SYLVAN-ELF HIGH-ELF GREY-ELF~
Sharp features such as pointed ears set this race apart from most.
They are known to be flightly and not dependable. Elves are also known to be
some of the best magicians around, as well as being among the most dexterous
races.

Grey Elf

	This is a race of magic beings, who excel in the arcane arts, and
their abilities to move about undetected (one way or another) are legendary.
Thus, they make excellent mages and thieves. Most of their kind live in the
forests; they are therefore well suited to professions of the forest, also.
They are not well known for being able to endure pain, however.

Sylvan Elf and High Elf

	Same as Grey elf, except : Sylvan elves are more geared towards
druids and rangers and warriors than mages, and are tougher; High elves are 
more intelligent, and less wise versions of Grey elves.  All of these elves
are basically good in nature.

~

52 EXITMAKING~
The 'rset exit' command is used to create, modify and remove exits in a room.
For more than one exit in the same direction see ADVANCEDEXITS.

The syntax of the 'rset exit' command is as follows:
rset exit <direction> [vnum] [exit-type] [key] [keyword(s)]
direction: one of: n, s, e, w, u, d, ne, nw, se, sw or ?
vnum     : the room number in which the exit leads to.
exit-type: a number detailing the exit -- has a door, open/closed/locked etc.
key      : a number corresponding to a key object which can unlock the door.
keywords : keywords used to refer to the door, (or exit).

If only 'rset exit <direction>' is specified, the exit will be removed.
The 'key' field is optional when specifying keywords.  All other fields are
required previous to the field desired.

Examples:
rset exit n 3001           - Creates an exit north to room 3001
rset exit n 3001 3 gate    - Changes the exit north to have a closed "gate"
rset exit n 3001 3 15 gate - Changes the gate to allow use of a key vnum 15
rset exit n                - Removes the north exit

See EXITTYPES for generating the exit-type value.
~

0 EXITS~

      4 - Door is Locked
      8 - Door is Secret      (Trying to go that way won't reveal door)
     32 - Door is Pickproof   (Door can't be picked by spell or skill)
     64 - Need to be able to fly to go that way
    128 - Need to be able to climb to go that way
   1024 - Door is Passdoor proof

NOTE: You must ADD the values together to generate an exit-type:
        3 = a closed door
        7 = a closed and locked door
       11 = a closed secret door
       15 = a closed, locked and secret door

-- Use the 'rset exflags' command to change these flags, and to set the
   advanced exit flags, most of which are not shown above.

See EXFLAGS and EXITMAKING.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Syntax:  level
 
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  Type LEVEL to see
how many experience points you'll need for the next few levels.
 
You gain experience by:
    inflicting damage upon an opponent
    being part of a group that kills an opponent
    succeeding while learning a skill or a spell through real world usage
 
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of some spells (energy drain, etc.)
    dying
 
The experience you get from a kill depends on several things:  how many 
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment and some random variation.
 
Your last 25 kills are recorded.  Each time you kill a creature that has
been one of your last 25 kills you will receive less and less exp for it.
The creature will also learn from its experience with you over time; if
its intelligence is higher than your own it will begin to gain an
advantage over you in combat.
~

0 EXPERIENCE XP~
Whenever you kill a monster or a player, you earn experience points.
When enough experience points are earned, you raise a level.  Things you should
know about experience points:

1 'EXTRADIMENSIONAL PORTAL'~
The Great Wizard Thanatos, after creating his fabled WarMagicks,
found himself snubbed and abused in and about The Realms for his
researches.  Much time would pass before mages and other classes
alike would learn the true power of these spells.
 
In the interim, disguised as an assassin, Thanatos became interested
in a more minor problem: that of carrying off the loot he gained
from all those he slew with Quantum Spike.  Realising that such a
forumla would be easily grasped by his class, he thought to extend
it freely.
 
As a final touch to the spell, he thought he would spite those of
other classes by inbuing into these containers a quality which made
them unobtainable by the other classes.

someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have to do is follow
yourself: "follow <your name>".

~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>; Syntax: group <character>; Syntax: group
 
'Follow' starts you following another character.  To stop following, type
'follow self'.  You cannot follow those more than ten levels above you.
 
'Group <character>' adds someone who is following you into your group, making
them a group member.  Group members share experience from kills, and may use
the GTELL and SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will
automatically join the fight.
 
If character is already a member of your group, using 'group <character>'
will remove them from your party.  Removing the character from the group
does not stop them from following you, however.  A character can also
leave your group by using the 'follow self' command, in which case they
will both leave your group and stop following you.
 
'Group' with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.
 
You may follow lower level characters or characters up to ten levels higher.
You may group only characters within eight levels of your own.
 
'Group all' groups all eligible players following you in the room.
 
'Group disband' allows a leader to disband his group (members stop following
 and are ungrouped).
~

59 FOR~
Syntax:  for <argument> <command>
Syntax:  for <argument> <command> <target>
 
For allows an immortal to perform a command at or even on a large
number of targets.  The arguments include:  all, mobs, gods.
 
Example:  for gods gl, you will 'glance' in the room of every god
who is online (include link-dead)
 
You can also perform an action on the argument target.
Example:  for mobs poke #, you will perform the 'poke' social on
every mob in the game.
 
'For' does not override private flags.
~

52 FORCE~
Syntax:  force <victim> <command>
Syntax:  force all <command>
 
Force forces one mob or character to execute a command.
 
FORCE 'all' forces _all_ everywhere in the game to execute a command,
typically used for 'force all save'.
 
Note that the level required to use force on mobs can be different
than the level required to use force on players, and can be adjusted
via 'cset' (see 'help cset').
 
~

56 FORCECLOSE~
Syntax: forceclose <descriptor>

This command will force a certain descriptor to close.
This is useful to disconnect connections that aren't really connected
due to a poor TCP connection.

It can also be used to forceclose a connection before a potential
problem player can even get to the authorization state of connection.

See USERS, CONSTATES and DISCONNECT.

61 FORMPASS~
Syntax:  formpass <new password> <character name>
Example: formpass temporary Joseph
                                       
Used to help in changing a character's password if they have forgotten or
misplaced their own.
 
This command will return the encrypted form of the specified password for
the specified character name.  Password and character name are case
sensitive, and the character name _must_ be capitalized.  The resulting
encrypted password must then be pasted into the character's pfile offline
by someone with access to player files.
 
~

51 FQUIT~
Syntax:  fquit <character>
 
Can be used by low-level imms to force a level 1 player to quit the game,
for example if the player is accidentally authorized or is causing problems
and there are no higher immortals around to deal with the problem.  Fquit
does not work on any player higher than level 1.

~

0 GAIN~
Usage : gain

When a newbie player first enters the mud, his/her CONFIGURE will be set
to AUTOGAIN.  This will be signified by a '+' sign in front of AUTOGAIN
when listed by the CONFIG command.  With this feature enabled, one does
NOT have to visit a guildmaster and type GAIN in order to advance to the
next level.  The advancement will be done automatically, when the
required experience points are achieved.
 
On the other hand, if one has the AUTOGAIN setting turned off, a (-)
will appear before the word AUTOGAIN in the Configure command listing.
This will mean that the player will have to visit his/her guildmaster and
type GAIN after receiving enough experience points to advance to a higher
level. Gaining will advance a player to the next level, give the hit points
earned, practices, and modify your abilities (such as THACO or backstab
multiplier). Until one gains, they will not be able to gain more experience
points than those points needed to be placed one point away from the next
highest level.

0 GATE~
Usage        : cast 'gate' <distant target>
Duration     : Unknown
Level        : 55 Mage, 55 Sorcerer
Minimum Cost : 100 magic points

	A more powerful version of the portal spell, gate opens a gate from 
you to another life form, which must exist before the spell is cast.  Once a
gate is opened, anyone may enter either side and be transported to the other
entrance immediately.  Gate allows for extraplanar travel, as well.

See Also: Portal
~

0 GET TAKE~
Usage : get <item> ((from) container)

	If you find something interesting on the ground, you may use 'get' to 
pick it up. Example: "get greatsword". If you are in a hurry, or if you just
feel very greedy, you may type "get all". You can also use 'get' to extract
objects from containers. Note that this command can be abbreviated with "g".
Example: "get dagger from bag".  Other examples:

  get all.bread from bag
  get 9*bread from 2.bag   (gets 9 breads from the second bag you have)
  get all from corpse

	This command has been fixed! There is no longer any ambiguity between
containers in your inventory and on the ground.  The ones in your inventory are
1..n and the ones on the ground are (n+1)..(n+m).

See Also: DROP PUT
~

56 GHOST LOADUP~
Syntax: loadup <player>
        ghost <player>

LOADUP allows one to load up a player's character (playing or not), to do
whatever needs be done to the character.  (Modifying a flag, changing a
password... etc).  Use FORCE to make the character do your bidding.

~

0 GITH~
The Gith are a race descended from humans.  Once long ago, they were a
peaceful civilization of humans that were captured by mind flayers and
tormented for centuries.  Eventually, a savior named Gith led them to
freedom, yet their bodies had been flayed by the mental powers of the
illithids.  The Gith found themselves, stronger, quicker, luckier and
smarter than average humans, yet they had lost much of their faith,
wisdom, stamina and charisma.
 
They had yellowed skin and were very long of limb.  Sunken eyes peered
from yellowed sockets, now strangely capable of naturally detecting
invisible things.  The Gith race has split into three distinct groups
recently.  The good, the Githzerai, the selfish neutral, the Pirates
of Gith, and the evil, the Githyanki.
~

0 GIVE~
Usage : give <item> (to) <person>

	If you feel benevolent, you may give some stuff to someone in need.

~

1 GLANCE~
syntax:  glance
syntax:  glance <victim>
 
Glance alone shows you only the contents of the room you are in,
eliminating the description.  Glance <victim> shows only the health
condition, eliminating their description and equipment from your
screen.
 
Glance may be abbreviated as 'gl'.
~

1 GLORY~
Glory is a measure of how valiant you are, and is accumulated by taking part
in quests and the like by the immortals.   It appears in 'score' as:
 
                    Glory: 264(430)
 
The number in parentheses is the total lifetime glory attained by a character,
and the other number is your current glory.  Glory can be "spent" to improve
items, weapons and the like.

~

0 GNOME~
Gnomes are very similar in appearance to dwarves, just... shorter, and
more prone to have white hair.  Some would say that these guys look like a
dwarf with a very large nose, I would not say that to a dwarf though.  Gnomes,
on the whole, are highly intelligent, but lacking in common sense.  They tend
to be above average at spellcasting, and again, like the dwarves, they are 
pious, and many take the vows of the clerics.
~

0 GOBLIN GOBLINOID GOBLINS~
Goblins have flat faces, broad noses, pointed ears, wide mouths, and
small, sharp fangs.  Their foreheads slope back and their eyes are usually
dull and glazed.  Though they walk upright, their arms usually hang down
almost to their knees.  Their skin color is generally deep orange or
reddish.  Then again, some goblins are green skinned.  Eyes are colored
either yellow or red.  An average goblin stands about four foot tall.

	They are not so much unliked as misunderstood. They are very agile,
but not very strong.  It seems that they were destined to be thieves.
~

1 GOLD~
Syntax:  gold
 
Displays the current total gold you are carrying.
~

0 GOSSIP~
Usage : gossip <message>

	This is similar to shout, but only people that have this channel turned
on and are in the same 'zone' as you will hear it. If you wanna just gab, this
is the way to do it. All immortals can hear gossip no matter what 'zone' you
are in.

~

52 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

GOTO takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

If the location is a vnum, and it does not already exist, and it is within
your room vnum range; it shall be created for your to edit further with
RSET.

You may not GOTO a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present.

See RSET.
~

0 GRAB HOLD~
Usage : grab <object>
        hold <object>

	For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example. The object
in question must be in your inventory and holdable, and you have to have a free
hand to put it in.

0 'GREY ELF' 'HIGH ELF' 'SYLVAN ELF' ELVEN ELF~
Tall, slender creatures with an affinity for the woods and nature, Elves
are distant cousins to the Pixies and share the intelligence and dexterity
of that winged race to a lesser degree.  With a lighter frame than Humans,
what they lack in strength and stamina is made up for with their superior
agility - both in thought and movement.  Elves are capable in all classes,
though they function poorest in the role of pure fighter.  Most Elves will
prefer to stay close to nature, and many become druids.  All Elves have
the inherent ability to detect magic.
 
The average Elf stands taller than most Humans, being well over six feet.
Most have fair skin and long, straight hair, though there are individual
Elves who chose a darker life reflected in their outward appearance.
 
~

1 GRIP~
This skill is automatic, once practiced.  The skill causes you to grip
your weapon tightly as someone tries to disarm you, making it far more
difficult to successfully disarm you.  This skill will only increase as
you are engaged in fights where someone is attempting to disarm you.
~

0 GROUPING GROUPS~
Usage : group (<victim> or "all")

	If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared
among group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been participating
in the fight.

Incentives for grouping... As if being able to kill much tougher mobs wasn't
incentive enough! :

1) leader of a group gets 5% exp bonus per kill per pc in group
2) followers get 3% bonus (per pc)

ABOUT EXP CAPS AND GROUPS

	There is a experience 'cap' on people NOT grouped with anyone else,
this cap is 200k per mob MAX. (k means multiply by a thousand, for those of you
non-nerd types) If you group with someone else the cap is then moved to 300k,
3 people and it is 400k and so on. If there are 8 people grouped then the cap
is 1m, anything over 8 the cap is 2million. In other words, you ONLY get more
experience (if the mob is worth a lot of experience) if you group.

	Group with no argument show a list of people who you are grouped with,
as well as their current hits, magic, and movement percentages.

	To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should NOT
follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for each 
player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader should remember
to include himself/herself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne both wish to group with Dragon.
Dragon doesn't mind, they raise his cap!

Quifael enters :  follow dragon
Redferne enters : follow dragon
Dragon enters : follow dragon (If he isn't already.)
Dragon enters : group dragon
Dragon enters : group redfern
Dragon enters : group quifael

These last three lines could just have been replaced with
dragon enters : group all

Later when Dragon gets upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he enters : group quifael -- to kick Quifael out of the group.

54 GRUB~
Here is some reference data you will need in order to use GRUB.
 
Sex          Class        Race         Fields   Clans        Councils
0 Neutral  0 Mage       0 Human        Name     1 1st Guild  1 1st Council

           4 Vampire    4 Pixie        Level
           5 Druid      5 Vampire      Room
           6 Ranger     6 Half Ogre    Gold
           7 Trainer    7 Half Orc     Clan

          11 Artificer                 Pkill
 	  12 Monk
	  13 Necromancer
	  14 AntiPaladin  

Here are some sample uses of GRUB:
 
grub 20 pkill=y class=5      Display 20 Druid pkillers
grub 20 level=2 last<=970120 Display 20 L2 players absent since 970120
grub 20 level>=20 level<=30  Display 20 players levels 20 thru 30
grub  0 level=2              Count the number of level 2 players
grub 20 level>50 gold>100000 Display 20 imms with more than 100k gold
grub 50 damroll>100 sex=2    Display 50 females with damroll>150
grub  0 class=5 damroll>150  Count the number of druids with damroll>100
grub 20 site=123.456.789     Display 20 players from site 123.456.789
grub 10 class=0 race=2       Display 10 dwarven mages
grub  1 name=Joe             Display Joe's info
grub 20 room=7070 class=0    Display 20 mages who logged off in 7070
grub  0 class!=2 class!=3 class!=4   Count the number of mana users
 
You always need to specify the number of lines you want displayed. The
reason for that is that we don't want to ask for a list and then get
surprised to find that it's 15,000 lines long. You can get a count
of the players that match your criteria by requesting zero lines.
 
GRUB will tell you how many lines there are in the list n matter how
many you ask to display. So if there are 15,000 players that meet yur
criteria and you ask for the first ten, GRUB will tell you there are
15,000 in total but will only show you the first ten.
 
See also: HELP 'GRUB EXAMPLES'
~

54 'GRUB EXAMPLES~
Here are some examples illustrating common usages:
 
Example:
 
grub 20 or hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
Suppose you want to search for "suspicious players". Suppose you want
to see players who have more than 200 million gold or whose damroll
exceeds 150 or whose hitroll exceeds 150 you can do that as follows:
 
Normally GRUB lists players who satisfy all the conditions you specify.
But it can also be used like this to list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
The operand "or" ensures GRUB will list players who satisfy any one of
the conditions.
 
If you had specified:
 
grub 20 hitroll>150 damroll>150 gold>200000000
 
That would show you players whose hitroll exceeds 150 and whose damroll
exceeds 150 and whose gold exceeds 200 million. It would be a much
smaller list and you would miss many suspicous players.
 
Example:
 
grub 20 name>ska name<skb room>=21000 room<=21499
 
Suppose someone complains that a player with a name like "Skathamaga"
picked up some of their eq and promptly quit the game. The player isn't
sure of the exact name of the thief but is sure it starts with "Ska".
The thief quit the game somewhere in New Darkhaven (vnums 21000-21499).
 
This example will show you players whose name starts with "Ska" and who
last quit the mud somewhere in New Darkhaven.
~

0 GTELL~
Usage : gtell <message>

	This command is similar to TELL with one major difference. It will tell
EVERYONE that is in your *group*. You can use this command while sleeping but
you can't hear it while sleeping. This will help you when you need to sleep.
NOW. But need to tell people things, too.

See Also :TELL, GROUP
~

0 GTELL ; REPLY SAY TELL~
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: say   <message>
Syntax: tell  <character> <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a message to
all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even if they are
sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote '''
is a synonym for SAY.
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work
even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their identity.  This
is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players.
 
~

0 GUILDMASTER~
A Guildmaster is a skilled npc where players go to learn and practice
skills or spells of their class.  Guildmasters can best be found by
exploring the large cities or areas nearby such as villages or other
type of camps depending on the class.
 
Guildmasters can also advance a player to a higher level if the required
experience has been achieved.  However if the player has AUTOGAIN turned
on, typing GAIN to advance, will not be necessary.  It will be done
automatically.
 
Newbie guildmasters are normally located in a player's hometown, or
city where the newbie player was created.  In two of the main cities,
Silverstone and Malaria, there are city guides that willingly will
provide directions to the guildmasters when asked for HELP.

~

0 HALF-ELF HALFELF HALFELVES~
A mixing of Human and Elven blood, these attractive creatures are neither
as intelligent as full-blood Elves (but moreso than Humans), nor as hardy
as full-blood Humans (but moreso than Elves).  They serve best in classes
which require a mix of mental and physical strength without demanding
superiority in either.  Half-elves carry the inherent Elven ability to
see limitedly in the dark with infravision.
 
Though not as tall as a pure-blood elf, a half-elf is a relatively tall
creature ranging from five foot five inches tall to six foot five inches,
with a generally more muscular build than the pure-blooded elf.
 
~

0 HALF-OGRE HALFOGRE~
Half-Ogres are offspring of the successful coupling of the neanderthal-like
Ogre with and Humans.  Standing from six to nine feet in height and packed
with bulging muscles, Half-Ogres possess great physical abilities, enabling
this race to thrive in battle.  Half-ogres tend to be less quick-witted
than humans and, like their pure-blood Ogre relatives, are aggressive in
the extreme, often engaging in battle to establish superiority, leaving the
loser shunned as a weakling incapable of survival.  Because of their human
parentage, Half-Ogres are not as large or powerful as pure-breed Ogres, but
nevertheless boast truly awesome strength.  Half-Ogres possess infravision.
 
The torso and limbs of many Half-Ogre are commonly covered in small, boney
growths.  Most are relatively hairless, with disproportionally long limbs,
giving many an ape-like appearance.  Their weight runs from three hundred
to four hundred pounds.
 
~

0 HALF-ORC HALF-ORCS HALFORC HALFORCS~
A recent mingling of Orcish and Human blood arising as the darker races
have encroached further upon the remaining settled areas, most members
of this half-blooded race are distinctly more Orcish than Human in both
appearance and behavior.  Large and dull of wit, with short but broad
bodies, their poor mental and physical dexterity is offset by an iron
constitution.  Though some have dabbled in the sorcerous arts due to
their human influence, brute combat is is still the natural call which
stirs in the soul of the Half-Orc.  All Half-Orcs possess infravision.
 
Though not as broad nor powerful as full-blood Orcs, Half-Orcs usually
retain their wider bodies, longer, bowed limbs and heavier musculature.
A ridged brow crowned by bushy eyebrows conceals small, squinting eyes;
below a snout-like noses opens a maw filled with crooked fangs; dark
skin emanating a rancid odor; their presence disgusts civilized races.
Standing from five to seven feet tall and averaging two hundred pounds,
an altogether fearsome race.
 
~

0 HALF-TROLL HALFTROLL~
An intermingling (carried out in the darker lands of the world) of the
blood of the Troll with that of Humans, the Half-troll is as deadly as
it is hideous.  Though considerably smaller than full-blood Trolls, the
Half-troll often stands well over eight feet in height and carries over
three hundred pounds on its heavily-muscled frame.  Though naturally of
low wisdom, the race was sorcerously imbued with a wicked intelligence
and the ability to see naturally in the darkness.  Half-trolls usually
make poor pure magic users, and suffer from an unusually low dexterity.
Yet their boundless energy and high intellect create one of the most
cunning physical beasts in experienced hands.
 
Owing in part to the black blood which courses through their heavy veins,
the heavily-scaled skin of the Half-troll ranges in color from a charcoal
grey to a deep, blackish green.  Half-trolls revel in the fright of their
appearance, often wearing their hair in battle-braids and emblazoning
themselves with brands and tattoos to accentuate the effect.
 
~

0 HALFLING HALFLINGS~
Short, slender, bull-headed and very mischievous the Halfling has a level
of dexterity which knows no equal, and many enjoy the thrill of stealing
valuables from other people.  Many halflings choose the path of the Thief,
for which their silent footstep and nimble fingers serve them well.  This
dexterity coupled with a surprising fearlessness makes them a ferocious
(though somewhat underpowered) opponent.
 
Halflings have compact bodies and thick, long limbs, and are usually
covered from head to toe in hair of varying thickness and color.
 
~

0 HALFLING HOBBIT~
Mini-humans is what they look like, but beyond that, they are 
vastly different... Halflings like to enjoy good food and lay about. They 
are good at most thief skills when born, although they are generally not a
evil race; they traditionally are what most would deem a peaceful folk.  This
peaceful nature has led some halflings to become druids.  However, most
halflings prefer a simple life (preferably with plenty of food).  Halflings
are physically weak compared to most races, but they are extremely quick.
Halflings make adept thieves, for some odd reason.
~

0 HARM~
Usage        : cast 'harm' <victim>
Duration     : Combat - cannot process commands for 2 rounds.
Level        : 25 Cleric
Damage       : 100 points, or enough to ALMOST kill.

Level         : 25 Cleric
Minimum Cost  : 100 magic points

69 HEDIT~
Syntax:  hedit [help topic]
 
This command allows you to edit a help topic.  If the specified help topic
does not exist, it will be created for you.  The default help page (summary)
will be selected if you do not specify a page.
 
NOTE - Always, when creating a new help entry, type Help <new entry name>
       prior to creating your entry. A pre-existing help file associated
       with that keyword may already exist.
&Y
Colors &wcan now be added to help files using the same command set that changes
a player prompt.  &bMultiple &Ycolor &wcombinations can be set on a given line
including ^bbackground^x colors.  However, there are a couple of quirks to take
note of:
&Y
    1) If the first line of your help file containers a color code and you are
       experiencing a display problem with the file, use a . to begin the file.
    2) Color changes should be separated by at least one character.  Example:
       '&&Y.^^r' will work, '&&Y^^r' may cause problems.
 
See HSET, PCOLORS.
~

51 HELL UNHELL~
Syntax: hell <character> <number> <hours or days>
Syntax: unhell <character>
 
The hell command sends a character to hell for a given period of time.  It
automatically releases the character when their time has been served.  Upon
being helled, the character receives the message, "The immortals are not 
pleased with your actions.  You shall remain in hell for <time period>."
 
Hell takes arguments of either hours or days.  To hell someone for 3 hours,
"hell <character> 3 hours."  To hell someone for three days, "hell <character>
3 days".  Hell will default to hours if hours or days is not specified.

To release a player from hell early, simply "unhell <character>".  
~

0 HELP~
Usage : help (topic)

	Basically, you can get help on any spell or skill, and certain topics
of interest, such as the following :

        help               - list of often-used commands
	help help          - you're reading it now
	help introduction  - Useful for people new to DaleMUD (Diku+Tiny)
	help areas         - nice list of where to go, and when to go
	help newbie        - useful for people new to DOTD
	help map           - gives you an map of part of the DOTD world

	Help searches for a partial match of the entered word, including any
spaces that may follow the word. If you put spaces after the topic, the help
will most likely not find that topic.

Note on spells : If help <spellname> doesn't give you the information you want,
                 (i.e. gives you help on an irrelevant subject) try :

			help "spell" <spellname>

                 (of course, leaving off the <> and "")

A (LONG) note on usages :
The symbols < and > surround REQUIRED parameters, which will consist of a word
substituted for the word in <>'s. (i.e. help <topic> means, that if you would
like help on a specific command, TELL for instance, you would type : help tell)
Parenthesis - ()'s, will surround OPTIONAL parameters.
Anything in double quotes, (i.e. "Anything") means, the word in quotes must
be present AS TYPED, unless it was in parenthesis as well... for example, the
help group entry reads :
Usage : group (<victim> or "all")
This means that the following are all acceptable commands :

  group
  group Bilbo (if Bilbo is in the room you are in, and following you)
  group all

See Also: The above topics, which can ALL be rather useful, even for 
           experienced players. 
~

0 HIDE~
Usage : hide

	When you type hide there is a chance that you hide in the room. If
hidden you can only be "sensed" by the "sense life" spell. Even if sensed, your
identity will remain hidden. Hide is broken by pressing return, regardless of
whether you typed a command or not. AFK works similarly.

See Also: AFK
~

0 HIDE SNEAK VISIBLE~
Syntax:  hide
Syntax:  sneak
Syntax:  visible
 
If you successfully HIDE, other characters and creatures cannot see you
unless they are affected by 'detect hidden'.
 
If you successfully SNEAK, you can move from place to place without being
noticed by other characters.
 
In order to HIDE or SNEAK successfully, you must practice the appropriate
skill.
 
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
effectively making you visible again to all.
~

60 HITALL~
Syntax: hitall
 
Hitall is a fighter skill that will start a fight by hitting all the
opponents in the room.  For nondeadly characters, the 'opponents' means
mobs, for deadlies it means all the deadly players in the room.
 
Be aware that area attacks are aggressive to all mobs in the room,
including pets, mounts and charmed creatures.
~

1 HLIST~
Syntax: hlist <low level range> <high level range>
 
This command will give you a listing of available help files. The list
is in alphabetical order based on the first triggering keyword. While
this command was initially designed as a maintenance tool to help us
track help files, it is also available to players so that they can
capture a listing of the help files available to them. 
 
Note - You may only view help files that are coded for viewing by your
       level or lower.
 
Note - The list of help files is quite extensive, and the command does
       not as yet have a way to filter/shorten the list. Screen capture
       is, at present, your only recourse.
 
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax:  hold   <object>
Syntax:  remove <object>
Syntax:  remove all
Syntax:  wear   <object>
Syntax:  wear   all
Syntax:  wield  <object>
 
Three of these commands will cause you to take an object from your inventory
and use it as equipment:
 
HOLD is for lights, wands and staves; WEAR is for armor; WIELD is for weapons.
 
You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.
 
WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD/WEAR/WIELD each suitable item in inventory.
 
REMOVE will take an object from your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
REMOVE ALL will remove all your equipment and place it into inventory.
 
~

51 HOLYLIGHT INVIS~
Syntax: holylight
Syntax: invis

HOLYLIGHT is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

INVIS is a toggle which makes you completely invisible to all player characters
of lower level than you, and to all mobiles.

When an immortal is INVIS, they will have a flag on the who list which 
indicates their level of invisibility, such as (51) for INVIS 51.  A 
similar flag will also appear when you 'LOOK' in a room - this flag will 
say (Invis 51).

HOLYLIGHT will not allow you to see immortal INVIS characters who are
higher level than you.
~

10 HOMEPAGE~
syntax: homepage <url>
 
example: homepage http://www.idirect.com/test.html
 
If you have a web page somewhere, you can use the homepage
command to show people a link to that page whenever they
select the 'see who's on' link from the Realms of Despair
home page.
 
To remove your homepage setting, type 'homepage clear'.
~

0 HOMETOWN~
When a player creates his/her character, they will choose a race.
This race will determine which hometown (city) the character will
belong to.
 
Presently, there are two main cities named Silverstone and Malaria.
Silverstone is home for the good races, and thus, Malaria is the
home for the evil races.  Each hometown will have guildmasters and
cityguides to help the newbie player gain new skills and learn the
directions to places to explore.
 
It is important to realize that if one is from Silverstone, it
would not be wise to venture into Malaria or vice-versa.  The
sentrys, Guardians, and other guards will attack you as an enemy,
and this may not be too cool, if they swarm on you like ants.
 
~

0 HOUSE HOUSES~
Houses allow the character who owns it to rent for half-price. 
The character enters the house, and types rent, and all the stuff is
stored.  No one else can rent in that room, just the owner.  Multi-room
houses are legal.  Houses are in pre-defined locations, you cannot choose
your location other than which city it is in (Silverstone or Malaria).

~

0 HP~
This is an abbreviation for hit points.  All classes begin with 20 hp
at creation and gain between 6 and 19 hp per gained level, depending on
class, race and CON.  Equipment can also add to your total hp.
~

69 HSET~
Syntax:  hset [help page] <field> [value]
 save                            Saves all help pages (to help.are)
 level <level>                   Sets help topic to specified level
 keyword <keywords>              Sets help keyword to specified keywords
 remove                          Removes the specified help page
 
Note:  If you wish to set more than one keyword to a help topic, enclose all
       the keywords, space separated inside quotes.  (Like in spellcasting)
Note:  If you have instances of multiple help files with the same keyname,
       using Hset Remove without a level designation will remove the one with
       the lowest level of access. ie:
 
       Help file XYZZY at level 57, and help file 'SAVE XYZZY' at level 58.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE XYZZY' will remove the level 57 XYZZY.
       Typing 'HSET REMOVE 58.XYZZY' will remove the level 58 'SAVE XYZZY'.

0 HUMAN~
Look in the mirror.  Humans are your basic Joe Normal, and are the
basis for comparison for all the other races.  They excel in everything they
do, so are not limited in levels, and can be of any class.  However, they 
have no particular distinction, other than being pretty common. 
~

0 HUMAN HUMANS~
Humans are the most numerous and least unusual of the races.  They possess 
no special abilities or bonuses, but also have no penalties.  Because of
this, Humans are extremely adaptable and are able to assume a variety of
classes and roles.
 
Humans are bipedal beings, boasting two arms, two legs and a roundish head.
Amazingly, Humans have a strange tendency to look different from each the
other; almost none look exactly alike.
 
~

0 HUNT~
This is the ranger skill that allows him/her to track somebody.

See Also: TRACKING
~

0 HYPNOSIS HYPNOTIZE~
Usage        : hypnotize <victim>
Duration     : 36 Hours
Level        : 2 Psionist
Minimum cost : 25 magic points
 
	This skill allows a psionist to 'hypnotize' a victim into following
him. This is similar to the spell charm and follows it in most respects to
rules. Remember that this skill is considered aggressive. If you fail, you're
fresh meat.

10 I3~
Syntax:

For Everyone:
i3 chanlist [all] [filter]
i3 mudlist [filter]
i3 listen <localchannel>
i3 chanwho <channel> <mud>
i3 mudinfo <mud>
i3 ignore <person@mud>
i3 invis

For Administrators Only:
i3 stats
i3 chanlayout <channel> <message> <emote>
i3 setup <channel> <localname> [level]
i3 addchan <channel> <type>
i3 removechan <channel>
i3 chanadmin <localchannel> <add|remove> <mudname>
i3 connect
i3 disconnect
i3 savechan
i3 debug

These are the configuration commands for Intermud-3.

I3 IGNORE allows you to selectively ignore users at certain muds.
You will effectively be invisible in all ways to them, with the
exception of public channels. They will not see you on who, finger,
or locate, and they will not be able to beep you.

I3 INVIS toggles your invisibility state. If you are i3invis, then
nobody on I3 can locate you or send tells, beeps, etc.
You will NOT however be made invisible for channels. If you use
a public channel, then people will see you on them. This is more
or less equivalent to an UberIgnore.

I3 CHANLIST gives an overview of all channels available on the
Intermud-3 network, the option "all" will give all channels instead
of the subscribed only and the option "filter" will display all
channels which prefix the string.

I3 MUDLIST gives an overview of all muds connected to the Intermud-3
network, the option "all" will also show the ones which are down
right now and the option "filter" will show only those which prefix
the string.

I3 CHANWHO gives an overview of all people on a certain mud
listening to the channel specified.

I3 MUDINFO gives information about a mud on the Intermud-3 network
with information as given by the Intermud-3 router to the mud.

I3 LISTEN will let you listen to a channel. To talk to the channel
use the name of the channel as the command.

~

10 I3EMOTE~
Syntax i3emote <name>@<mud> <message>

An Intermud-3 command:

Sends a private emote to a person on another mud.

See also: i3, intermud3
~

10 I3FINGER~
Syntax i3finger <name>@<mud>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests for information regarding a player on a mud.
Operates in a similar manner to the local 'finger' command.
Will only reveal information the target mud feels is appropriate.

See also i3, intermud3, finger
~

10 I3LOCATE~
Syntax i3locate <name>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests on all the muds on the Intermud-3 network if a person
known by the name is there. Be patient when using this command,
there are a lot of muds on the network to search through, so
a response may take some time to come back.

See also: i3, intermud3
~

10 I3TELL I3REPLY~
Syntax: i3tell <name>@<mud> <message>
Syntax: i3reply <message>

An Intermud-3 command:

i3tell sends a private message to a person on another mud.
Due to limitations in the code, you can only use a one word
mud name to target the tell to. Otherwise this command operates
in much the same way as the local tell command.

To reply to the last i3tell you received, simply type 'i3reply'
followed by your message and it will be sent back to the last
person on I3 who sent a tell to you. Works in the same manner
as the local reply command.

See also: i3, intermud3, tell, reply
~

10 I3WHO~
Syntax i3who <mud>

An Intermud-3 command:

Requests an overview of players on a different mud.
Operates similarly to the local who command.

~

-1 ICE IMCCHAT~
ICE - the IMC Channel Extensions protocol

ICE is a response to the cesspool-like attributes that rchat, rimm, and
even rcode have acquired over the last few months. It is IRC-ish in some
ways, but hopefully it will be used more constructively than IRC.

For a quick introduction and setup guide for ICE, see ICE-INTRO

The basic ICE structure is (greatly simplified):

. Some nodes on IMC - normally hubs - run channel daemon code that
  manages channels
. Each of these nodes maintains a list of the channels they manage, and
  the various attributes of them - who owns them, and so on
. The daemons regularly tell all muds on IMC what channels they have, and
  what their attributes are
. Based on this information, the muds on IMC decide which of their local
  users can use which ICE channels. If one mud is modified to ignore these
  restrictions, then the other muds will recognize this (since they, too,
  know the restrictions) and ignore messages from that mud.

Every channel on ICE is of the form nodename:channelname, for example a
channel called hub2:IAdmin is the channel IAdmin maintained by the node hub2.
Each mud picks which channels it is interested in (see ILIST and
ISETUP) and creates a local channel name which can be used to talk on
that channel.

Generally, any admin on a mud can create a channel on any node - although
nodes can be configured to restrict who can create channels. Whoever
creates a channel owns it, and can control who can use that channel (in
whatever way they wish). The trick, of course, is to persuade the admins
of other muds that your channel has value. Creating and modifying a
channel is done via the ICOMMAND command.

Channels can be tuned into and out of on a player-by-player basis by
using the ICHAN command.

There are a variety of ways of controlling who can hear and use a channel
- see ICE-POLICY for more information.

~

-1 ICE-INTRO~
A Quick Introduction to ICE

This assumes that the code for IMC and ICE is installed and running, and
that you have an active connection to an IMC network.

1. ILIST. This will give you a list of possible channels to choose from.
   Pick one that you want to add, that has a policy of 'open'. Note its
   name (of the form node:channel).

2. Decide what command you want to use to speak on this channel on your
   mud. This is the channel's localname.

3. Type: ISETUP ADD <node:channel> <localname>

4. You should now be able to use the channel. Others can listen to and
   speak on the channel by using ICHAN <localname>.

5. You may wish to reconfigure the default local channel settings.
   ILIST <localname> will display them; ISETUP will change them.

6. Repeat for whatever other channels you wish to have.

~

-1 ICE-POLICY~
ICE Channel Policies

Channels can have one of three policies - open, closed, and private. They
also have one owner, and zero or more operators (assigned by the owner).
They also have an include and exclude list (which can specify both
individual players ['user@mud'] and entire muds ['mud']), which can be
modified by the owner and the operators.

- Open. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel). People on the exclude list cannot use the channel,
  with the exception of people also on the invite list. This means, for
  example, if an entire mud is excluded and one player is invited, that
  player can use the channel, but the rest of the mud can't.

- Closed. The channel can be accessed by all muds on the network (it is a
  broadcast channel), but by default they will not hear or be able to use
  it. People on the invite list can use the channel, with the exception of
  people also on the exclude list.

- Private. Identical to closed, except that the channel is actually only
  physically sent to those muds that are on the invite list. This is good
  for channels specific to a small group of muds, and not of interest to
  the majority of the network.

0 ICESHIELD~
This spell will surround you with a shield of ice, that will return your
enemies attacks with tongues of ice!
~

0 ICHAN~
Syntax:  ichan               - display current ICE channel status
         ichan <localname>   - toggle an ICE channel

IChan lets you show and toggle which ICE channels you are listening
to. Without arguments, it will show you the channels you belog to; with
an argument, it will turn on or off that channel.

Any channels you listen to must be locally configured first - see
ISETUP. ILIST can be used to see available channels.

See also: IMC ICE ILIST ISETUP
~

0 ICOMMAND~
Syntax:          icommand <command> <channel> [<data..>]
Common commands:  create <channel>           - create a channel
                  refresh <channel>          - refresh channel data
                  list [<channel>]           - list available commands
                  destroy <channel>          - destroy a channel
                  policy <channel> <policy>  - change channel policy
                  addop <channel> <name>     - add a channel operator
                  removeop <channel> <name>  - remove an operator
                  invite <channel> <name>    - add an invited name
                  uninvite <channel> <name>  - remove an invited name
                  exclude <channel> <name>   - exclude a name
                  unexclude <channel> <name> - remove an exclusion

ICommand is used to send commands to a channel daemon elsewhere on IMC.
It directly affects the channel itself - any changes made here will
affect all muds using the channel.

Since the actual commands are interpreted by the channel daemon, not your
mud, what is available may vary. To get a list of available commands, use
icommand list <nodename> for public commands, or icommand list
<node:channel> to see what commands you have for that channel.

icommand refresh asks the daemon to refresh your mud's information for a
channel, if it ever gets out of synx. Asking for a refresh of nodename:*
will refresh all channels on that daemon.

icommand create creates a new channel, with you as the owner
icommand destroy destroys a channel. You must own the channel.

icommand policy changes the basic policy of the channel (see ICE-POLICY).
You must be the owner.

icommand addop/removeop add and remove operators from a channel. You must
be the owner, and specify the operator's full user@mud name.

icommand invite/uninvite/exclude/unexcluded modify the invite and exclude
lists for a channel. You must be the owner or an operator on the channel.
Either a full user@mud or a simple 'mud' name (no @) can be specified.
See ICE-POLICY for more details.

~

0 ILIST~
Syntax:  ilist               - list all known ICE channels
         ilist <channel>     - list details on one ICE channel

IList displays information on channels active on ICE.
Without arguments, it will produce a display similar to:

Name            Local name      Owner           Policy
hub2:IAdmin     IAdmin          Nemon@AR        open
hub2:ICode      ICode                                    (inactive)
hub2:test       (not local)     Nemon@ARtest    private

This shows the canonical name (eg. hub2:IAdmin), the local name (eg IAdmin
- which can be used as an abbreviation in ISETUP, and which is also
the command to speak on that channel), the owner of the channel (eg.
Nemon@AR), and the channel's policy (see ICE-POLICY).

If a channel is not configured locally, it will have (not local) for its
local name.

If a channel is configured locally, but is not actually active on IMC, it
will have an (inactive) flag on it.

IList with a channel name will provide detailed information on that
channel. For example:

Channel hub2:IAdmin:
  Local name: IAdmin
  Format 1:   (IAdmin) %s: %s
  Format 2:   (IAdmin) %s %s
  Level:      102

  Policy:     open
  Owner:      Nemon@AR
  Operators:  Drylock@AR
  Invited:    NiceGuy@SomeMud
  Excluded:   SomeMud

This displays the channel name, local name, policy, and owner, as above. It
also displays:

- the minimum level needed on your mud to see the channel

- the format for displaying messages from the channel. These can contain
  any color codes etc. that your mud uses.

  Format1 is the string displayed when someone speaks normally on the
  channel - the first %s is replaced by their name, the second %s by what
  they say.

  Format2 is a similar string for emotes. Again the first %s is their name,
  the second %s the text of their emote.

- any operators for the channel. This can only be changed by the owner of
  the channel. Operators can modify the 'invited' and 'excluded' fields
  via the ISETUP command.

- the invited and excluded people on the channel. See ICE-POLICY for
  more details.

~

-1 IMC~
IMC (Inter-Mud Communication) provides a way for muds to connect together and
share various services: chat channels, tells, notes, who listings, and so on.

The available mortal-level IMC commands are as follows. See the help topics
for each of these for more information.

- IMCLIST : get a list of active muds that are connected to IMC.
- RCHAT   : send a message on the common chat channel.
- RWHO    : send a who request to a mud.
- RTELL   : send a tell to someone on another mud.
- RREPLY  : reply to a rtell from someone on another mud.
- RQUERY  : ask for information of some type from another mud.
- RBEEP   : "beep" another player. Use sparingly.
- RWHOIS  : find someone on IMC
- RFINGER : get information about a player on another mud
- ISTATS  : get some (interesting?) stats about IMC.
- RCHAN   : show which channels you are listening to, and modify that state.

There is also provision for inter-mud notes/mail; see 'IMC NOTES'.

IMC2 was written by Oliver Jowett <oliver@sa-search.massey.ac.nz>, aka
Spectrum. Mail me if you're interested in connecting to the IMC network.

0 'IMC CONFIG'~
The 'imc' command is used to configure your IMC setup:

Syntax:  imc add <mudname>            - add a new IMC connection entry
         imc set <...>                - set the details of an IMC connection
         imc delete <mudname>         - remove an IMC connection
         imc rename <old> <new>       - rename an IMC connection
         imc reload                   - load a new IMC config file from disk
         imc localname <name>         - set the local IMC name
         imc localport <port>         - set the local IMC port

Add, delete, and rename should be self-explanatory. The name of an IMC
connection MUST match the name which the other end is using.

Reload destroys the version of the configuration in memory, and reloads it
from disk. This is useful if you have hand-edited the config file and want
to load your changes without rebooting. 'imc reload' also reloads the
rignores file.

The set command has several forms:

imc set <mudname> all <data...>     - set all values for a mud
                  host <hostname>   - set the hostname to connect to
                  port <portnum>    - set the remote IMC port to connect to
                  clientpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive client password
                  serverpw <pw>     - set the case-sensitive server password
                  rcvstamp <value>  - set the receivestamp
                  noforward <value> - set the noforward bitmask
                  flags <value>     - set the connection flags

The 'all' form takes a series of values:

imc set <mudname> all <host> <port> <clientpw> <serverpw> <rcvstamp>
                      <noforward> <flags>

For information on the exact details of each field, see the IMC documentation.

The localname and localport commands set the IMC name and port of -your- mud.
Use with care.

-1 'IMC IMMORTAL COMMANDS' RINFO~
IMC Immortal commands:

- RINFO       : A channel which the various hubs put status reports onto. Can
                be spammy at times; you may want to turn off rinfo for this
                reason.
- RSOCKETS    : displays debugging info on the current IMC connection state.
- RCONNECT    : force a connection to a directly connected mud.
- RDISCONNECT : forcibly disconnect a directly connected mud.
- RIGNORE     : ignore a player or an entire mud on IMC.
- MAILQUEUE   : show the current queue of pending inter-mud notes.
- IMC         : edit the IMC configuration for your mud (see 'IMC CONFIG')
- RCHANSET    : manage access to IMC channels/rtell/rbeep for players.
- RPING       : trace IMC connectivity

See also: IMC
~

-1 'IMC NOTES'~
Notes (boards, mail, etc) are very mud-dependent, but in general, if they
have been connected to IMC, then you can simply write notes to player@mudname
in addition to normal 'player'.

For example, you may be able to do:

note to abcde@somemud anotherplayer immortal@someothermud

and the note would go to:
  abcde on the mud called 'somemud'
  anotherplayer on your mud
  all immortals on the mud called 'someothermud'

The 'playernames' used are interpreted by the mud that receives them, not
your mud, so be careful when writing notes to group names such as 'immortal'.

If your note cannot be delivered within 12 hours for some reason (if the
mud is down, does not exist, or refused your mail) then you will get a note
from the system telling you so.

~

0 IMCLIST~
Syntax:  imclist                  - get a list of active muds on IMC
         imclist direct           - get a list of directly connected muds
         imclist config           - see the local IMC config

'imclist' lists active muds on IMC. It lists all the muds which this mud knows
about on the IMC network, and when they were last heard from. The 'route'
section is mainly for diagnostics, and indicates the route that your mud will
send packets via to get to another mud.

'imclist direct' shows direct connections from your mud to other muds.

'imclist config' shows the local IMC configuration and state.

56 'IMM AUTH' 'IMM AUTHORIZE'~
Associated help files: authorize
 
Authorize <player> name -- This is the command used to allow a player to
  continue in the Spectral Gate pre-auth area, but will make them choose
  a new name prior to entering the Academy.  Use this command if the name
  is questionable, modern, or rude.  If the name is acceptible, but in all
  caps, accept the name, but send them a tell requesting they not use all
  caps for their name in the future.
 
Authorize <player> yes -- This is used to accept a players name.  Once this
  command is used, the player requires no further Immortal commands to enter
  the Realms.
 
Authorize <player> no -- This command is exclusively used to deny players
  with extremely rude or profane names and banned sites.  Use this command
  sparingly.
 
Levels 51-54 have primary responsibility for character authorization.  All
Immortals should periodically type 'authorize' to assure their are not any
players waiting for authorization.  The new system allows the Immortals a
bit of time to decide if an name is appropriate before accepting or denying
it.  If you are in doubts to a names acceptibilty, but it is not profane or
extremely modern, you should probably accept it.
~

0 IMMORTALITY~
Well, you all know what immortals are?  Well, they are the goodly 
folks that keep the mud in good running order (implementors (imps), 
a.k.a. coders, An, *sir*, etc...), handle complaints, build zones 
(builders, gods), and learn as much about the MUD as possible (hopefully 
they already know a fair amount) so they can perform these offices well.

Top ten reasons why *you* want to be an immort :

10. You play 14 hours a day.... why the hell not?
 9. The chicks (or guys) dig it. Did I mention you get to become any race, too?
 8. "at", "go", "trans"... what more could you want?!
 7. Who *doesn't* want to live forever?
 6. Instant omnipotence. (You want to know how much stuff there is to know?)
 5. No more shouting. (global gossip, woohoo!)
 4. You can spend all your time having ideas. No more mobs to kill, after all.
 3. "Kill the Morts" day .... umm, just kidding.
 2. You'll be respected more (yeah, right...)
 1. It's not just a job, it's an adventure! (build zones, make your dreams
    come true, get to act really goofy and call yourself eccentric!)

	However, as with everything in life (i.e., death) there's a down side.
A certain room in the hall of rules states the "Immortal Prime Directive"
which are rules immorts must adhere to. Basically, once you immort, you 
can't help PCs physically, or give away hard-to-get information for free.

	To become immort, you need to be adept (61+ levels), and possess
an extensive knowledge of DOTD in general (DaleMUD experience should
work well) and an administrator (very high-level immorts - [Garil, Nabu])
to promote you.  Low-level aspirants will be made immortal by application
only, or by special cases to be determined by the administrators, on a
case-by-case basis.

~

59 IMMORTALIZE~
Syntax:  immortalize <character>
 
Used to advance a level 60 character (avatar) to level 61 (the first
level of immortality).  This command will destroy the character's
inventory and display to them a pre-written message.

~

62 IMOTD~
&GAdvertise this mud (but not on other muds)!

&RNew Immortals!  If you are inactive for longer than a week you will
be deleted!
&W
Please read the rules at room 3294, and the immortal rules at 666.
The Immortal board is in room 1000.
 
You are expected to know them, to sum them up, if you leave mortals
alone (unless given permission) and you don't harass other immortals,
you'll be fine.

&BIf you find any bugs or have any ideas, post them on the board in 1000.
Even if you tell somebody like Garil about them, post them anyway.

&YVote on the applications or else! &RTHIS MEANS YOU!
~

0 IMPLEMENTORS~
The most powerful beings in existence.  Their function is mostly
administrative.  Don't whine too much in their presence.
~

0 INDUCT OUTCAST~
Syntax:  induct  <player>
         outcast <player>
 
Induct and outcast are clan commands.  The leader and number 1 of the 
clan receive the induct commands, while the deity, leader, number 1 and 
number 2 all receive outcast.  Induct will bring a new player into the 
clan, while outcast will remove them.
 
~

0 INFO~
Usage : info

	Gives you some useful hints and information about the game. This 
information could be rather outdated.
~

0 INFO NOINFO~
Usage : noinfo

	The info channel tells you what's going on in the world... deaths,
level gains, and reboot warnings, for the most part.

	NOINFO lets you not see info messages (say you're sick of seeing
people level...), so just keep this in mind.
~

1 INFORMATION~
SLIST   - a command that lists all your spells and skills and the level at
          which you may practice them.
AREAS   - Typing AREAS will get you a list of all areas.  You may get more
          information on each area by typing HELP <full area name>.
WIZLIST - This is a list of all Immortals of the game.
COMMANDS- This is a list of all commands available to you.
SOCIALS - This is a list of all socials available. 
TIME    - This will tell you the current times inside the game, the time
          the game was last rebooted, and the current time at the sight.
WHERE   - Where will give you a list of other players in the same area.
SAVE    - After level two, typing SAVE will save your process.
QUIT    - If you want to leave the game, type QUIT.
WHO     - A list of other players visible to you in the game.
TITLE   - Once you reach level five, you may make your own title.
PASSWORD- Your character's password can be changed with PASSWORD <old> <new>.
DESC    - You may set up a personal description, type DESC to edit.
 
Note that this is only a very brief list of commands.
~

0 INFRAVISION~
Syntax: cast infravision <character>

This spell enables the target character to see other players and mobiles
that are in the room with them.  This spell will also allow you to get
items from a corpse, but will not allow you to see the corpse.  You
must have a light source to see items, room descriptions, or "exits" in
a dark room.
~

0 'INNER WARMTH' INNER WARMTH~
This spell makes you more resistant to all forms of coldness.
~

0 INNS~
Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper
looks after his equipment and treasure. Specifically, you may use inns to store
your gathered equipment while you are not playing the game (we all have to
sleep sometimes, there is no shame in that).

See Also: OFFER, RENT
~

59 INSTALLAREA~
Syntax:  installarea <area filename> <full area name/title>
 
Installs a prototype area into the mud as a non-prototype area.  The
filename can be fixed with aset (don't forget to foldarea afterwards).
 
Installarea renames the installed area file from 'author.are.file' to
'author.are.installed' so that the builder may be assigned new vnums.
 
~

54 INSTAROOM INSTAZONE~
Syntax:  instaroom
 
Functions the same as instazone, but is room-based instead of area-based.
 
Syntax:  instazone [nodoors]
 
This command lets your instantly create a whole set of resets for your area
based on all the mobiles and objects contained within your area.
All you have to do is place each mob in its proper room, wearing what it
should be wearing, carrying what it should be carrying, and objects in their
proper places, or in their proper containers, and doors in their proper
states, (open, closed, locked).  The instazone command will clear out your
current resets (if any), and create new ones for you.
You may optionally specify "nodoors" so that door resets will not be
created.
 
NOTE:  This command will wipe out any existing resets!  Do not use this
command after you have added your own resets with 'reset add'.
The recommended procedure is to use instazone, then use the 'reset' command
to add any special resets, and NOT use instazone again.
 
See RESET and RESETCMDS.
~

1 INTELLIGENCE INT~
Intelligence (INT in your 'score') represents your character's mental
capacity.  Among other things, it affects:
 
 - heavily influences the amount of mana a character gains at level
 
 - affects the amount of mana regenerated or recovered at each tick
   if a character is resting or sleeping
 
 - the rate at which a character learns a new skill or spell
 
 - the percentage rate at which a character practices a new language
 
Intelligence is an important factor in learning between combatants.  If
a character fights a creature several times, the more intelligent of the
two opponents will gain an advantage over time...
 
Intelligence is the prime attribute of the mage.
~

0 INTENSIFY~
Usage	     : mind 'intensify'
Duration     : (psionist's level) / 10 Hours
Level        : 27 Psionist
Minimum cost : 100 magic points

        Increases hitroll and damroll by level/20. Mechanically similar to 
adrenalize, but this skill causes the muscles of the victim to become larger
for a short period of time. Similar to a steroid. Self only.

See Also: ADRENALIZE
~

0 INTERMUD3~
Intermud-3 is a protocol which allows you to chat with people on
other muds who are also connected to Intermud-3. It is primarily
populated by LP based muds at this time, but the hope is to get
more Diku based muds to join over time. While some may say that
Diku based muds would be better served on the IMC Network, it
is far easier for a mud to obtain a connection to the Intermud-3
network, and the commands to use it are generally simpler.
In either case, should a mud desire it, Intermud-3 will coexist
peacefully with an IMC enabled mud. Currently there is no way
for public or private traffic to be passed from one network to
the other.

~

0 INTRO~
Syntax:  intro <player name>
	 intro setintro <your intro>

To introduce yourself to somebody, type intro <name>.  You can use their
introduction as well.

To set your introduction, or how others see you when you arn't introduced
to them, type intro setintro <your intro>.  Note that you can only set
this once after you are above level 1, while at level 1 you can set it as
many times as you like to fine tune it or correct typos.

0 INTRODUCTION~
Things you might be interested in:

	There are almost 300 skills and spells, more on the way.
	Many monsters have special routines.
	Monsters that ought to have poison do. Poison is very dangerous.
	Some poisonous monsters have instantly fatal poison.  Take care!
	Equipment can be damaged by spells and in combat.
	Dragons' breath does lots of damage to people and equipment.
	Non pc followers only get 1/2 the exp they would get if they weren't
		charmed.  the other 1/2 is lost.
	Some monsters are too big to bash... in general, dragons, most 'huge'
		things, purple worm, etc, are all non-bashable.
	Sneak allows you to avoid aggressive monsters.
	Monsters develop hatreds very quickly, and will try to hunt you down  
		and kill you for hurting them (or giving them the finger!)
	Kangaroos hate all kinds of enfan.
	Mobs that should see in the dark probably do.
	Monsters can be immune against that which you would expect them to be.
	Some monsters are also resistant to certain attacks and/or susceptible
		to others (resist = 1/2 damage, susc = 2* dam)
	Monsters HELP each other out.  They don't sit by and watch.

	Player characters are very powerful:  many spells, attacks, etc.
Monsters are weaker individually, most of the time.  However, the monsters here
are not as stupid as they are on (some) other muds, and they tend to be 
tougher, because of that, and because they help each other.

	Rule of thumb:  Grouping is ALWAYS a good idea.

	It is easier to play mages and thieves if you are patient.  You don't
	have to be as patient, if you are more willing to group.

	The goals for the classes:

	Fighters  : powerful at lower levels, much less useful at higher levels.
	Clerics   : reasonably powerful and useful all along.
	Mages     : weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
	Thieves   : Good for scouting, very nice when grouped.
	Monks     : Weak at lower levels, more powerful at higher levels.
	Druids    : Medium at all levels, like clerics.
	Psionists : A diverse class, with unique skills

	Spellcasting is harder to do in combat. Generally, the more powerful
the spell, the harder to cast in combat. Magic missile, acid blast, shocking
grasp, and cause light, serious, and critical, are all fairly easy to cast in
combat.

	While your equipment can be damaged by spells and such, there are some
things you can do minimize the damage.  #1, if you are fighting something that
does fire damage, being immune or resistant to fire yourself will help your
equipment out as well. #2, good saves will reduce the amount of damage.

See Also: HELP
~

0 INVENTORY~
Usage : inventory

	If you are uncertain about what you are carrying, or simply want to
check that no thieves have pilfered from your backpack. You can abbreviate
this command with 'i'.

~

0 INVIS 'MASS INVIS'~
Syntax: cast invis <character>
Syntax: cast 'mass invis'

The INVIS spell makes the target character invisible.  Invisible characters
will become visible when they attack.

The MASS INVIS spell makes all characters in the caster's group invisible,
including the caster.
~

0 INVISIBILITY~
Usage        : cast 'invisibility' <target>
Duration     : 24 hours on living targets, permanent on objects.
Level        : 4 Mage, 4 Sorcerer
Minimum Cost : 5 magic points
 
	This spell causes the target to turn invisible.  Only those who are able
to detect invisibility will be able to see it.  Attacking while invisible will
immediately break the spell.  Another way to become visibile is to type VIS.

See Also: DETECT INVISIBILITY
~

0 ISETUP~
Syntax: isetup add <ice-channel> <localname>   - add a channel
        isetup delete <localname>              - delete a channel
        isetup rename <oldname> <newname>      - rename a channel
        isetup format1 <localname> <format>    - change format1 on a channel
        isetup format2 <localname> <format>    - change format2 on a channel
        isetup level <localname> <level>       - set channel level

ISetup allows you to change the local configuration of an ICE
channel. None of these commands have a lasting effect on the channel's
configuration on other muds.

ISetup add begins the configuration of a channel. It connects the
specified ice-channel (of the form nodename:channelname) to a local name.
For example: isetup add hub2:IAdmin IAdmin. The local name is also the
command used to speak on the channel.

When the channel is added, various default values are filled in for
format1, format2, and level.

ISetup delete removes this link. It does not affect the channel itself;
it just deletes the local configuration link for the channel.

ISetup rename changes the local name of a channel. It does not affect the
channel name itself for other muds - just the command used locally to
access it.

ISetup format1 and format2 change how a channel is displayed locally.
Each format string must have exactly two %s's within it (this is checked
for) - the first will be replaced by the speaker's name, the second by
whatever they say. Format1 is used for normal speech, format2 for emotes.
See ILIST for more information.

ISetup level sets the minimum level necessary on your mud to hear or use
the channel.

~

0 ISTATS~
Syntax:  istats                     - display use(less?) statistics

istats shows some (maybe :) interesting statistics about how much traffic your
mud is generating due to IMC.

0 JUGGERNAUT~
Usage        : cast 'juggernaut' (self)
Duration     : Unknown
Level        : 53 Mage, 53 Sorcerer
Minimum Cost : 80 magic points

	This spell : makes you REAL BIG, and naked, and makes ya hit REAL HARD
                     and have BIG hp... those are the consequences, live 
                     with them or regret forgetting them.
~

0 KARATE~
This skill gives enhanced combat prowess to whoever possesses it. 
(i.e., more damage per strike) However, it takes a long time to learn, and
can only be mastered to 5%. It is an automatic skill, and will be effective
if you have it practiced.
~

0 KICK~
Usage : kick <victim>
Damage : (warrior's level / 2) ... (twice as much for monks)

	The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The higher
level you are, the harder you kick. There is one small catch - whenever you 
kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for the next three rounds
of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee! This is one of the 
monks' most awesome weapons.  Use it wisely.

See Also: RESCUE, BASH, MONK DAMAGE, MONK ATTACKS
~

0 KILL HIT~
Usage : kill <victim>
        hit <victim>

	A good way to start a fight.
~

0 LANGUAGES~
Syntax: languages
Syntax: language learn <language name>

Languages alone shows which languages you know, and "language learn 
<name>" will add to your percentage of language knowledge.  To learn a 
language, a scholar who is knowledgable in that tongue must be present.

If someone is speaking in a language, and you know it, you will 
understand what they are saying.  However, to change the language in which 
you are speaking, you must change that manually.  (See help on SPEAK).

Also see help on TONGUES.

56 LAST~
Syntax:  last <character>

53 LAYERS~
.
&gLayers are currently available on the following wear locations:
 
&GAbout, Arms, Body, Feet, Hands, Legs, Waist.
 
&gLayers are set with a numeric value, or combination of values.  The lower
the value, the lower the layer, or thinner the item of clothing/armor is.
 
Valid numeric values are:
 
&G0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.
 
&gOr any combination of the above. A value of zero means no other items came
be layered with this item. Items of clothing can be layered over one another
as long as their layer values do not overlap. ie, if leather armor were set
to a value of 56 (8, 16, and 32), it could not layer with, say, a set of
heavy chain that is set to a value of 96 (32 and 64), as they overlap on the
layer value of 32.

0 LEAVE~
Usage : leave

	If you feel claustrophobic, typing 'leave' will make you use the
nearest obvious exit to the outside.

See Also: ENTER
~

0 LEGENDS SUPERMORTALS~
Well, what can you say about people who have gone beyond the ranks
of mortal prowess previously assumed to be the highest possible, in their
respective class? Hmm, perhaps that requires rephrasing...

	A legend is a mortal character who has surpassed the rank of "Master"
in their chosen profession (or at least one of their chosen professions, 
in the case of certain multi-class persons).  All persons in all classes will
attain the rank of "Legend" upon getting a certain amount of experience
points, and gaining at their guild... nothing fancy.  Legends generally
get more powerful skills and abilities than mortals, and more skills are
being added each month.

	Legends may also petition to become immortal... if you have the
levels, you will always be allowed to attempt to become immortal, but
there are duties inherent to the position, as well as all the handy little
extras you get by being immortal.  Note the word 'attempt' in this
paragraph.  You will be tested, and can only be an immortal if you pass.
Not a test of prowess - but of knowledge. This is your warning.

0 LEVITATION~

~

0 LIGHT~

This lights the herb in your pipe.  Once lit, the herb will continue to
burn until it burns itself out, is smoked out, or you tamp your pipe.
 
See SMOKE, TAMP, FILL
~

0 LINKDEAD~
A lot of players have problems with their links to the game. This
could be very dangerous to your health in the middle of a combat. But
we have worked out a solution. There are two cases:

  I.If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee
    each time someone attempts to hit you. If you manage to flee, then
    you will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until
    you reconnect to the game.

 II.If your link jams (freezes) you got a problem. The only solution
    we can give, is that you break your link as quickly as possible. By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

 Addendum to II : you can reconnect without dropping link.  This is known as
    usurping your body.  Therefore, you never have to ask for a disconnect.
    So, if your link freezes, and you can open another telnet (or tin, or 
    whatever) session, you're in good shape.

~

0 LOAD NOTCH~
The command parameters are 'notch <item>'. You will then attempt to
notch/load the item into the weapon you currently wield. You can also use
'load <item>' , it will have the SAME results. This is how you can notch a
arrow to FIRE at someone or something.

See Also: FIRE
~

0 'LOCATE OBJECT'~
Syntax: cast 'locate object' <name>

This spell reveals the location of all objects with the given name.
~

72 LOG SNOOP~
Syntax:  log   <character>
Syntax:  log   all
Syntax:  snoop <character>
 
LOG <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file and to the log channel.  Like FREEZE, it is a permanent
character toggle that persists across reboots until removed.
 
Certain commands (such as password) are protected against LOG.  Conversely,
certain commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.
 
LOG ALL logs all character and mob commands and actions to the server's log
file, but does not send the output to the log channel.  It is a server-wide
toggle; it does not persist across reboots.
 
SNOOP shows you a copy of all the input and output going to a character.  The
character must have an open channel.  You may snoop more than one character
at a time.  The input from the player will be displayed with a header of the
players  name and a percentage sign (i.e. Mudder%)
 
SNOOP yourself to cancel all outstanding snoops.
 
~

0 LOOK~
Usage : look ((at or to) (the)) (direction or object or person)
        look in <object>

Examples:
	look AT the angel
	look IN the bag
	look to the south   (or just: look south)
 
	Note that if you LOOK AT CORPSE you will not see its inventory.
To see what is inside a container (i.e. corpse) use LOOK IN <OBJECT>.

See Also: EXAMINE, READ
~

0 LORE~
Usage : consider <target>

	Lore tells you the vital statistics of a mob, compared to yours, but
only if you have the appropriate lore skill. To use it, type 'consider X'.
If X is a race that you know lore about, you can get some info on your target.
As your ability with the skill improves, your estimates will improve. 
Characters who have lore are also better at backstabbing creatures they know
something about.
~

1 LOYAL LOYALTY~
The item flag 'loyal' reflects a weapon's loyal status.  Such a weapon will
return to a player's inventory when disarmed.
 
Note that a weapon will only be loyal to a deadly character, and it will be
loyal regardless of whether or not a mob or a player (peaceful or deadly)
disarms the wielder.  Non-deadly characters will gain no advantage with
a loyal weapon.
 
~

0 MAGICUSER MAGE MAGES~
A mage is one of the weakest class when it comes to body, but their minds
have no par.  As a mage you will begin weak, but as you grow in knowledge
and power, you will become a powerful fighting force.  Mages' spells are
varied and sundry, but they get many more combat spells than the clerics.
With a mage's vast repertoire of useful spells you will become a much
sought after commodity ... for your spells can mean victory or defeat
for other players.
 
~

1 'MAGNETIC THRUST'~
'Magnetic Thrust,' much like 'Sonic Resonance,' allows the casting
Mage to control the nature of space and time in the immediate locale
of his victim.  In this sorcery, the Mage forms a wedge of magnetic
energy within the body of the victim.  As the spell progresses, the
victims organs are violently rent and internal tissues are torn.  The
resulting pain and damage are formidible, indeed.
 
~

0 MAIL~
Syntax: mail list
Syntax: mail read    <number>
Syntax: mail read    all
Syntax: mail write
Syntax: mail subject <string>
Syntax: mail to      <to-list>
Syntax: mail take    <number>
Syntax: mail show
Syntax: mail post
Syntax: mail remove  <number>

The mail command is very similar to the note command.  To write mail, as 
in notes, you must have a blank note held in your hands, and a quill or 
pen in your inventory.  Mail can only be addressed to real players, or 
'all'.  There is a charge for reading and taking mail.
~

0 MAILQUEUE~
Syntax:  mailqueue                         - show current IMC mailqueue

This command simply shows the current contents of the outgoing IMC mailqueue
for inter-mud notes. Due to the internal implementation of this (static
buffers - ick), only the first 8-9 entries will be shown.

Creates a new shop and assigns it to a mobile.

The levels of the items in the shop are picked randomly based on item type:

61 MAKEWIZLIST~
Syntax:  makewizlist
 
Used to generate a new wizlist during game operation (a new wizlist
is automatically created at each reboot).  A character recently
immortalized may need to 'save' first if they don't show up on the
newly created wizlist.
 
~

75 MALARIA~
Malaria is one of the major cities in Desolation of the Dragon II.
It is the hometown of evil races such as Trollish, Dark Elves, Mind
flayers...etc.
 
The good counterpart of Malaria is Silverstone, home of the good
races such as Humans, ELves, Half-elves...etc.

Race alignment plays an important factor when venturing through one
of these cities.  If a player is opposite aligned, coming from the
opposing city, beware of an attack by a guard, sentry, or the
Guardian of that city.

MIML Grammar: #keyword#arg1,arg2,argx#display if true#display if false#

Valid keywords: aff, aff2, act, act2, plr, plr2, objroom, mobroom
drunk, mentalstate, spell, variable

MIML is a system whereby the MUD can customize output to a player based on
any number of things.  Room descriptions can, for example, be customized
to show a player with true sight some secret, or if in the lair of a beast
the beast is dead, the room can reflect that.

MIML is a work in progress, please keep that in mind.

Example:
You are #aff#flying#flying above#standing in# an alley, between
two buildings.  #aff#flying#Looking down, you see many piles of refuse.##
The alley is quite dark, and you #aff#truesight#can see many forms scurrying
about doing business in the underground#have trouble making out the path#.

Notes: The #keyword#arg1,arg2,argx# portion should be on one line, otherwise
the MIML interpreter will not recognize them because they will contain CRLF's.

fingers on each hand, not including the thumb. Mindflayers are famed for
the power of their minds.  Their race has collectively forgotten all
pursuits of the body and physical prowess in favor of developing their
powerful mental talents.

~

0 MULTICLASS~
Multiclass means that a certain race may be able to have more than one class
available at the same time.  For Example:  Mage/Thief   
 
When a player first creates a character to play on the mud, one of the possible
choices will be whether you want to have more than one class at the beginning.
The disadvantage of multiclass is that it takes longer to get enough experience
points to go up in levels when you have more than one class.  The advantages
can outweigh the disadvantages though, in that your character will have more
skills and spells available which can be very advantageous in the overall aspect
of the mud.
 
Humans, mindflayers, and dark dwarves cannot have multiple classes to start out
with in the game.  However, humans do have the ability to multiclass at level
10 or higher by changing classes with the command new_class.  Please refer to
the help on new_class for further information on that.
 
To see what multiclasses are available for the different races, please refer
to our web page at http://www.dotd.com and click on Classes, you will get 
a list of the possibilities.

&RImmortality is finally within your grasp...

~

-1 M_BALZHUR_~
.&RSuddenly out of nowhere, a hideous beast appears, bringing with it the
horrible smell of brimstone, death and decay!

&YThe demon gives you the most evil and spine tingling sneer that makes you
fall to your knees, and release your bladder... 

&GThe next second, the immense mass of slimey muscle and claws is all over you
...shredding you to a bloody mess!

&PMercifully, everything goes black as it moves its widening maw towards your
head...
~

-1 M_GODLVL10_~
.&GYou are all powerful!
~

-1 M_GODLVL1_~
.&G...Everything begins to fade to black.

You feel yourself leaving your body... rising up into the air, you feel
indeed much more free than you have ever felt before...

You float high into the heavens... a vortex of ever-changing curved beams
of colored light swirling around you faster and faster...

Your soul is bursting with emotions you can barely conceive...
You feel a burning inside... both cold and hot... a tingle of electricity
grows into a powerful buzzing surge jolting through every inch of your body.

A strange chorus of voices begins to sing indecipherable and long forgotten
words... the singing grows louder and louder... a million voices as one.

You feel yourself losing touch with reality... and all goes quiet.
~

-1 M_GODLVL2_~
.&G...You begin to feel light-headed.

Your hands begin to tingle softly...
The feeling quickly grows into a strange radiating pulse of energy! 

The tingle rises up your arms and into your head, filing your mind with
visions of worlds of wonder, far off places, great towers, vast mountains,
oceans, seas, lush valleys, dark caverns and twisted passages...
 
You sense a feeling of wonderous potential and power in your hands...
Enough power to build and create these visions for yourself!

You feel much more powerful, eager and inspired!
~

-1 M_GODLVL3_~
.&G...You feel slightly faint as your head begins to spin.

Your hands begin to tingle once more...
A vortex of energy starts to swirl throughout your hands, going faster
and faster... becoming almost painful! 

Beams of light break through your skin, one at a time, then more and
more until the light is almost to bright to bear...

As your squint your eyes, you perceive a vision of great beasts of wonder,
dangerous and unnatural fiends, pixies, faeries, tribes and clans, peoples
of all kinds, ancient forgotten artifacts, weapons of vast untapped powers,
crystal balls, magick rings, staves, wands, rods, arcane tomes of untold
secrets... your mind is bursting with inspiration...
 
You sense a new, reborn feeling of unlimited potential and power...
In your hands the power to build and create these visions for yourself!

The bright light from your hands fades away... but strange faint glow
remains always.

0 NECROMANCER~
From the steamy recesses of the swamps comes a figure cloaked in mystery.
The Necromancer, as the name implies, is an unseemly form of sorcerer whose
spells deal with the raising of the dead and the summoning and control of
various creatures for their purpose.  Though their goals are often aligned
with those of the forces of Light, some do not think that these ends can
justify their foul means.  Long hours of study in dank mausolea have made
their skin pale and corpse-like, their figure, skeletal.  Most people shun
them for their peculiar looks and ways, but none doubt the power of the 
Necromancer, for it is the stuff of nightmares.
        You can improve your skills by using the practice command, in the
room in the necromancer's guild with the guildmaster (usually the last room)

0 NEWBIE INERT INEPT~
These are a few things that should help you get started.

Start:
 - Depending on your race you will start in either Silverstone (good races)
   or Malaria (evil races)
 - Explore the cities first. There are many shops and possibly other players
   who can help you.
 - You might find some starting equipment in the Donation Room. There is one
   in each city, ask around or explore to find it.
 - Another place you should visit is your guild. Each guild is represented
   in both cities (or close by). Here you can learn new skills and spells.
 - Type help for a list of available commands and then help <command> for
   more info on each command.
 - You are expected to be aware of the rules of the mud. They are in the
   hall of rules in Silverstone and along the stairway to hell in Malaria.

Communicating:
 - Use say <text> to talk to people in the room with you. Although if you
   aren't all speaking the same language you may not understand each other.
 - Use tell <player> <text>  to speak to a particular player. Tell has a
   limited range, however, there are no language barriers.
 - Use gossip <text> to send a general message to all in the area.
 - Use shout <text> to send a message to everyone on the mud.
 - When you are grouped with others you can use gtell <text> to talk to
   others in your group.
 - Misuse of gossip and shout commands may lead to you being denied them.
 - Check the help menu for other communications commands.
  
Fighting:
 - Allways consider a monster (by typing consider <monster> ) before you
   try to attack. This will give you an idea of your chances.
 - Monsters of the same race will assist each other in combat, so be careful
   about attacking groups of monsters.
 - Cityguards will occasionally help you in battles. Depending on your
   allignment.
 - Cityguards will attack people of opposite race. ie Silverstone guards will
   attack evil race players and Malaria guards will attack good races.
 - Your race side (Good or Evil) is shown when you type score.
 - You can set wimpy to a value eg typing Wimpy 10 will make you try to flee
   from combat if your hit points go below 10. You may or may not suceed.

Gaining levels/skills:
 - When you gain enough experience points the mud will inform you that you
   have leveled. Seek out your guild master to gain the new level.
 - After you gain you will receive a number of practices which you can use
   to learn new skills and spells.
 - Most skills / spells improve slowly with use so you may only need to
   practice them once. Additional practices improve your abilities faster.
 - To check on your skills during game play type prac <class> and you will
 - see what the status is for each skills / spells you have learned.

the guild guard and typing this command.
     example:  new_class
The existing class then becomes dormant or inactive, until the player's
new class obtains one level higher than what the old class was before
dualing.  Further, since new class starts at level 1 again, all equip
will need to be shed that is required for higher levels, and/or class
dependant.  Once either the required level is reached and/or the
previous class status is obtained, the equipment can be worn again.

64 OSET~
Syntax:  oset <object>    <field> <value>

If the copy of the object you are currently modifying has the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will also modify the index of that object, which all other
instances of the object are based on.  In the future, every copy of that obj
will reflect your modifications.
 
Also be aware that modifications to the object affect list (everything that
is listed after 'object values') will affect _every_ copy of that object in
the game, including old copies (even if they are not online).  Thus if you
change a prototype-flagged copy of a sword to +4 damroll, every copy of that
vnum ever made will reflect that change.  If you add a 'magic' flag to that
sword, however, only copies made after the change will be affected.
 
If the copy of the object you are modifying does NOT have the PROTOTYPE flag,
your modifications will affect only that copy.
 
OSET ON will lock you onto a particular object.  Once locked on, all commands
commands will imply 'oset <object>'.  Hitting enter while in OSET ON gives
you an ostat of the object you are working on.  To get out of OSET ON, simply
type the word DONE. Example:
 
        oset staff on
        long A long gnarled staff of burnished oak lies here.
        type staff
        done

-1 PALADIN PALADINS~
The Paladin
___________________________________________________________
"You are the most excellent of men and your lips have been anointed with
grace, since God has blessed you forever.  Gird your sword upon your side,
O mighty one; clothe yourself with splendor and majesty.

In your majesty ride forth victoriously in behalf of truth, humility and
righteousness; let your right hand display awesome deeds.

Let your sharp arrows pierce the hearts of the king's enemies; let the
nations fall beneath your feet...

You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has
set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy...

I will perpetuate your memory through all generations; therefore the
nations will praise you for ever and ever..."
___________________________________________________________

Paladins are warrior priests who draw their power from acts of righteousness
and strict adherence to the Code of The Temple of Solomon.  Their strength
in battle, combined with the ability to perform limited miracles is offset
by the difficulty they experience in perfecting their craft, and the penalties
they suffer when they stray from the path of good.

0 RANGER~

self-sufficent person, the ranger is adapatable and can survive in almost
any locale.  Skilled with weapons and able to utilize some of the finest
armor available, a ranger is more than skilled enough to defeat most of
his foes.  However, for especially hardy opponents, a ranger also can cast
many useful spells to both hinder his opponent and aid himself.  From minor
curative magics, to calling down lightning from a cloudy sky, the ranger is
the most adept class at surviving on its own.  A ranger typically travels
light, but he does have the mighty strength of a warrior to carry equipment
needed in his travels.  Like the druid (a class he closely resembles), his
need for help from outside sources is low.

before assigning a range to ensure that there will be no vnum conflicts.
You can also use the 'vnums' command for a complete list of currently
allocated ranges, and the 'newzones' command for a complete list of
prototype vnum ranges.
 
Warning:  *Never* assign any vnums to a character who has another vnum
range assigned to them via 'aassign'.  Simply be sure to have the
character type 'aassign none' before assigning vnums to them.
 
Example:  massign Joseph 9000 9099
 
This will assign the vnum range from 9000 to 9099 for rooms to Joseph.
It is best to keep an areas object, room and mob range the same.
 
Be sure to always use 'checkvnums' to ensure the vnums you are going to
assign are clear.
 
See CHECKVNUMS, ZONES, NEWZONES, VNUMS

~

0 RCHANNELS RCHAN RINVIS~
Syntax:  rchannels                  - display your current IMC channel state
         rchannels +<channel>       - turn on an IMC channel
         rchannels -<channel>       - turn off an IMC channel

rchannels on its own will show you which IMC channels you have access to, and
whether they are currently on or off.

rchannels with an argument will turn on or off a given IMC channel that you
have access to.

rchannels can also be used to block rtells and rbeeps if necessary.

One additional option is rinvis. rchannels +rinvis will make you totally
invisible to IMC: you cannot be contacted by rtell, rreply, or rbeep, and
you do not appear on rwho. However, you cannot use any IMC channels while
rinvis is active (you can still hear them, though). rchannels -rinvis will
reverse this state.

Immortals may allow you access to IMC channels, or revoke your access to 
them, as necessary.

0 RCHANSET~
Syntax:  chanset <player>             - see a players current IMC flags
         chanset <player> +<channel>  - set 'allow' flag on a player
         chanset <player> -<channel>  - set 'deny' flag on a player
         chanset <player> =<channel>  - reset allow/deny flags on a player

This command allows you to view or change a players IMC channel priviliges.
In all cases <channel> can be the name of an IMC channel (rchat, rcode, etc)
or 'rtell' or 'rbeep'.

Setting the allow flag for a channel allows that player to see and use that
channel, regardless of their level. This can be used, for example, to give
mortals with coding experience access to rcode.

Setting the deny flag for a channel prevents that player from using or
seeing that channel, even if their level normally allows them to. This can be
used as a penalty for players who abuse the IMC channels or rtell/rbeep.

Resetting the allow/deny flags simply clears them, using only the player's
level to determing whether they can use the channel.

Usage        : cast 'reincarnate' <victim>
Duration     : Instant
Level        : 39 Druid
Minimum Cost : 50 magic points (special)

	Upon casting this spell the caster summons the slain Player Character's
spirit from the nether world and inserts it into a new body.  This body may be
of any race, and may not be a race the PC really wants to be stuck with. This
spell must be cast outdoors in a forest on a player character's corpse.  It
lowers the constitution of the victim by one, and will no longer work when the
victim is down to a 3 con. The victim must also NOT enter the game. Doing so
will makes the corpse too weak to be reincarnated. The victim may be at the
entry prompt. If the victim is at the entry prompt, they will automatically be
returned to the game.  Casting this spell is a great strain upon the caster.
It will drain the character's movement, hit points, and mana to at least 1.

0 RIDE RIDING~
It is possible to mount horses and dragons. Certain aspects are not 
finalized, so it is not advisable to mount aggressive dragons.  Currently
there are no horses of the correct race to be ridden, so, for the moment, it
is only possible to ride dragons. However, dragons are not docile creatures,
and it will take a large amount of riding skill, and a high level character
to do it with any amount of ability.  You can order your mount to do things,
as if he/she was a follower, but he/she isn't, so you can't group with the
mount.  Each time you attack something, or your mount attacks something, or
each time you take damage or your mount takes damage, you have a chance of
being thrown from the back of your mount. It is easier for evil chars to 
ride evil dragons, and good chars to ride good dragons.  

	To get an idea of how powerful one has to be to ride dragons, 
a 60th level character can typically only successfully ride on
Yevaud if said character has a -1000 alignment, or is affected
by the dragon-riding spell.  Or if Yevaud is heavily damaged.

0 RIGNORE~
Syntax:  rignore                           - list current rignores
         rignore ignore  <pattern>         - ignore player(s) or mud(s)
         rignore notrust <pattern>         - don't trust player(s) or mud(s)
	 rignore delete  <pattern>         - remove a rignore

rignore ignores or restricts the access, at a mud-wide level, everything
coming in over IMC for a specified player or group of players. Currently
two possible actions are possible: ignore and notrust.

Ignore means:

- rtells/rbeeps/rwhos will be ignored, and a rtell sent back to say that the
  mud is ignoring them.
- no messages from them on rchat, rcode, etc will appear on your mud.

Notrust means:

- any rwho/rfinger/etc requests from a mud/player matching the pattern will
  be treated as if they were from a level 1 mortal - ie. wizi imms will never
  be revealed on rwho, and rtells won't see them, etc.
- any incoming channel messages from something matching the pattern are
  stripped of wizi status - they will be visible to everyone in general.

Patterns can be one of:

  player@mud              - matches a specific player at a specific mud
  *suffix                 - matches anything ending with that suffix
                            (commonly used as *@mud)
  prefix*                 - matches anything beginning with that prefix
                            (for example, player@*)
  *substring*             - matches anything containing that substring

Use with care.

0 RQUERY~
Syntax:  rquery <mudname> help         - ask for available rquery options
         rquery <mudname> <option>     - ask for information from a mud

RQuery is similar to rwho, except it requests different information from a
mud. Each mud differs in what information it supplies, but 'rquery <mudname>
help' will give you a list of options that you can ask for.

Typically at least the following are supported:

rquery <mud> who        - ask for a who listing, identical to 'rwho'
rquery <mud> info       - get general information on the mud, usually including
                          its address. This is the preferred way of finding
                          out the address of a mud on IMC - don't ask on rchat!
rquery <mud> list       - ask for a list of IMC connections, from that mud's
                          point of view. Identical to 'imclist' on the remote
                          mud.
rquery <mud> istats     - ask for some IMC statistics, identical to 'istats' on
                          the remote mud.

0 RTELL RREPLY~
Syntax:  rtell <player@mudname> <message>    - send a 'tell' to another player
         rreply <message>                    - send a 'tell' to the last player
                                               to send you a rtell

rtell and rreply are the IMC equivalents of tell and reply, and work nearly
identically. To rtell, however, you need to supply both a playername and a
mudname (as shown in 'imclist'). rreply will reply to the last rtell you
received from a player - even if that player was invisible to you.

58 RULES DEADLY~
~

0 RUN~
To RUN simply type 'run <dir>' where <dir> is the direction you wish
to run (north,south,east,west,up,down). You will then be 'hurried' through
the rooms/locations until you get to a room that does not have a exit in the
direction you are running. In other words if you 'run west' you will run
westwards until you get to a room without an exit west. Run requires one 
movement point per room travelled through. You must have a certain amount 
of movement before you are allowed to run.
 
WARNING : You CAN run into a DEATHTRAP this way!
~

0 RWHO~
Syntax:  rwho <mudname>               - ask for a who listing from another mud

'rwho' asks the given mud for a 'who' listing of its current players. Depending
on the network, it may take several seconds to get a response. You should use
the mud abbreviation listed in 'imclist' when issuing a rwho.

See also: IMC IMCLIST RQUERY RWHOIS
~

0 RWHOIS~
Syntax:  rwhois <playername>          - find a player on IMC

'rwhois' asks all muds on IMC for a player with the given name. You should not
include a @mudname section - just the playername. Replies will be returned
from those muds who have a player by that name connected.

0 SAY TELL WHISPER SHOUT OOC ASK~
Usage : say <message>
	tell <person> <message>
	whisper <person> <message>
	shout <message>
	ooc <message>
	ask <person> <message>

	If you consider communicating with other beings, you might be
understood better if you start your sentences with either say, tell, whisper,
gossip, shout, or ooc.

	When using SAY you speak in a language that you choose, via SPEAK.
If the PC's do not understand you will not be able to communicate. All other
commands (tell,gossip,shout,whisper) do not use a special language.
 
Example : say I'm a jerk
          tell unclesam You're dead meat - sucker!
 
You can use ' as a shorthand for say, as in:
 
' hello there.

Notes : whisper and ask : can only be directed to a person in your room.
	say : will be heard by eveybody in the room.
	tell : can only be directed to people in your zone.
	shout : everybody on DOTD who isn't DEAF will hear you. This costs
                mana and movement.
	ooc : same as shout, and should be used for all times rather than
          gossiping or shouting, in the case of non-roleplaying
	      communications.  (OOC = Out Of Character)

	pause <enable,disable/off>
	war   <enable> see RACE WAR, or you might DIE!
	autoexits <enable,disable>
	group name <Group Name Here>
	group order <enable,disable>
	autoloot <enable,disable>
	permtitle <enable,disable>

* 'email'
The 'field' is email@address, something like jobob@hsc.unt.edu.
This information can be seen on a finger on your name.
	
* 'ansi'
set ansi enable : Lets you see colors if you have a color terminal.
                  However, on black and white, it makes some things bold.
         disable : Turns colors off (if you're getting a headache)

set pause enable : Makes long-scrolling messages pause so you can read them.
          disable : Lets everything scroll by recklessly.

                 opposite yours.

                       for you when you walk into a different 'room'.
              disable : For those brave souls who don't NEED to know how to 
                        exit the room. (or have memorized it. ;) )

* 'group' 
The type 'group' uses the field 'name <name>' to set your group name. After 
'name' you need to pass a name you would like to use for your group. 

Example : set group name The Wild Banditos!

Using 'gwho' you can see all the groups and their group names.

The type 'order' will allow you to accept orders from the group leader, and
the group leader only. You must be following someone before this will work.
This has been disabled until its abusive power has been curtailed.

* 'autoloot'
If autoloot is enabled, you'll grab everything that you can carry (i.e.
money, equipment, keys, etc) off of whatever you've just killed.

* 'permtitle'
set permtitle enable : If permtitle is enabled, your title will not change 
                       when you level.
              disable : well, if you like re-typing your title in after gain...

the trouble of all those echos :) ) and for the daily boot.  The manual
bit is used by the mud to determine whether the boot time was set by 
hand.  When the mud starts up, the boot time is set to 0600hrs (6am)
and the manual bit to 0.  If 'setboot time' is used, the mud sets the
manual bit to 1.  When it comes time to do the reboot, the mud checks
how long it has been running.  If it has been running less than 18 
hours and the reboot time has not been set manually, the reboot does
not take place (nor do the automatic warning echoes).

Echoes: when a scheduled reboot is coming up, the mud will send out
echoes to that effect.  The echoes start 30 minutes before the reboot
and are repeated at t minus 15, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute(s).

0 SHOPS~
Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the
perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific
type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if
it is of high quality!

	To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers
are rugged, capable men and women; roughened by years of trading and, indeed,
surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.
(They *usually* have a few thousand hitpoints and can shoot through schools).

in casting if both you and your victim are in an outdoor area -- you need

~

0 SPECIALIZATION~
If you are a mage, sorcerer, cleric, or druid you can specialize in
a spell so that no matter what, you never fail casting the spell. However it
is costly and hard to do. First you must already be superb at the spell, second
it will cost you 4 pracs, and finally it costs around 250k in gold.

	You can only specialize in a set number of spells, so take care when
doing so.

	Mortal specialization is disabled at this time.

1100 and 1101.  The object of vnum 1100 will get consumed by the spell,
and the object of vnum 1101 will not.

around him/her.  After one has typed 'spy', one can look in various directions,
and given that there is an exit in that direction, and nothing blocking the way
(like a closed door), then the contents of the other room will be displayed, if
the character is successfully spying.

0 STEAL~
Usage : steal <object> <victim>

	This skill is used to steal gold or items from people. The chance of
not getting caught depends on how well you steal, and works much better if the
target is asleep.

	Due to misuse of the steal command, it now requires you to be at least
second level to steal from other players. You can still steal from monsters at
all levels.

Example:
> steal gold drunk
~

0 STEALTH~
Gods use this to sneak into a room without their bamfin and bamfout
messages appearing.  Mortals usually wish they could do this, but so far none
have been able to.
~

0 STRENGTH~
Usage        : cast 'strength' <victim>
Duration     : (caster's level) * 2 hours
Level        : 6 Mage, 6 Sorcerer
Minimum cost : 10 magic points

	This spell increases the victim's strength by a random amount. Warriors
have 1d8 points of strength added, Clerics and Thieves 1d6, and anyone else 1d4.
Mobiles are treated differently from players and usually only 1d6 points of
strength will be added.

See Also: WEAKNESS
~

1 STRENGTH STR~
Strength (STR in your 'score') represents your character's physical power.
 
The most common concern with strength deals with how much your character
can carry.  For each additional point of strength  you gain an additional
amount of maximum carryable weight.  Any character with 20 strength can
carry 500kgs; Warriors and Rangers can have a maximum of 25 strength, and
can therefore carry up to 999kgs when their strength is at its maximum.
 
Strength also affects (among other things):
 
 - damage roll and hitroll; for each additional point of strength, each
   of these will increase
 
 - chances of success for bash, stun, bashdoor, shove and drag, and the
   ability to dual-wield heavier weapons
 
Strength is the prime attribute of warriors and rangers.
~

0 STUN~
Syntax: stun <mob>

Stun is a skill which can only be used once a fight has started.  It will 
stun your opponent if successful.
~

1 'SULFUROUS SPRAY'~
With the incantation 'Sulfurous Spray,' the casting mage culls from
the air the elements necessary to form a strong acid which rains
down upon his opponent or opponents.  This strength and velocity
of the spray is such that it can work its way into various forms
of armor and clothing, and it is also able to harm opponents one
might think resistant to such attacks, due to its magical nature.

0 SUMMON~
Usage        : cast 'summon' <victim>
Duration     : Instant
Level        : 19 Cleric, 27 Mage, 27 Sorcerer
Save         : save vs spell when applicable
Minimum cost : 20 magic points

Will summon a person of the name spoken.  You can summon any level player, but
if you attempt to summon a monster,it will get a saving throw, and you may wind
up with the wrong monster.  You cannot summon from or to NO SUMMON rooms, nor
can you summon from or to NO MAGIC rooms.  You cannot summon to TUNNEL rooms,
nor to PEACEFUL rooms, nor from PEACEFUL rooms.  You cannot summon someone who
is fighting, as it is impossible to get a precise fix of their location. 
Finally, if you try to summon a mobile from a crowded room, you may grab a 
different mob out of that room instead.  Summon spends energy from the
Caster.  Immediately after summoning, the caster will be too exhausted
to move or do much of anything for a short period of time.

~

1 SUMMON SUMMONING~
Syntax:  cast summon <character>
 
This spell summons a character from elsewhere in the game to your own
location ... and stuns your character.
 
Characters who are fighting cannot be summoned.  Do not summon aggressive
mobs into an area lower in level than the one from which they came, and
do not summon aggressive mobs of any level into Darkhaven.
~

1 SUPPLICATE~
Syntax:  supplicate <supplication>
 
Supplicate begs your deity (if you have one) for aid.  You may supplicate
for 'corpse', which retrieves your corpse, 'avatar', which summons an avatar
of the deity, 'object', which summons an object of the deity and 'recall',
which sends the player back to his recall point (bypassing norecall flag).
 
Note:  All deities offer corpse and recall, while object and avatar are for
particular deities only.
 
Deadlies may not supplicate for their corpse.
 
SEE ALSO:  deities, favor, devote.
 
~

0 SWITCH~
Usage : hit <target>

	Allows you to switch opponents. If you are attacking X and want to
attack Y, type 'hit Y'. If you are good enough at switching, you stop attacking
X, and big attacking Y.. if you fail, you stop attacking anyone. (Until you get
hit again, then you resume.)

See Also: HIT
~

51 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
Syntax: return

already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC).

RETURN returns you to your original body.
~

0 SWORDBAIT~
This spell makes the victim more susceptible to slashing attacks.
~

0 TAMP~
Syntax:  tamp <pipe>

See FILL, LIGHT, SMOKE
~

0 TAN SKIN~
Usage : tan corpse <equipment type>

	This skill will allow a warrior type class to tan the corpse of
his/her victims into armor. Armor types that can be made are:

	shield,helmet,jacket,sleeves,leggings,boots,bag and gloves.

	Remember that some monsters have thicker hide (thus better armor) so
explore to find the best armor! Dragons are always a good choice, the stronger
the monster (the higher the level) more than likely the better the armor will
be as well.

The following would tan a dragon corpse into a shield.
Example : tan dragon shield
~

Usage	     : mind 'telekinesis' <name> <dir>
Duration     : Instant/Combat spell - unable to process commands for 2 rounds.
Level        : 35 Psionist
Saves	     : vs. ??? to remain in position

Save         : vs. spells to avoid being moved

See Also: TELEPORT WITHOUT ERROR, PSIONIC TELEPORT
~

0 THIEF~
Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class
offers. Many of these qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as
picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented, however, so do not expect
to be able to kill many things by yourself. The useful aspect of thieves
involves their ability to scout ahead, avoiding monsters, detecting and
removing traps and selling and buying items at the black market.
	You can improve your skills by using the practice command with your 
guildmaster.
 
See Also: PRACTICE
~

0 THIEF THIEVES~
The thief is a dark character which makes use of many skills often deemed
improper by the rest of society.  The skills of the thief reflect his way
of life, namely sneaking in the dark, picking locks, and attacking from
behind with deadly backstabs.  Thieves have always had a bad reputation
so don't be suprised if you are always under suspicion.  Thieves start off
fairly weak, but as they gain skills such as backstab and circle they soon
become dangerous foes.  A thief is always usefull when there is a lock
that needs opening or an item that needs to be stolen.
 
~

58 THINK IMMTALK~
Syntax:  think <message>
 
Allows you to use the 'think' channel, which functions the same as all
other channels and can only be seen by those of high enough level.
The level for access to think can be controlled with 'cset'.
 
See CSET
~

0 THROW~
Usage : throw <object> <target>

	This command will allow a throwable object such as a throwing dagger
to be thrown at a target. This is similar to the fire/shoot command and can
be used in conjunction with SPOT.

See Also: FIRE SHOOT, SPOT
~

0 TICK~
Many of the actions in the game are based upon interval timers, including
combat, most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell
duration, weather, and area resetting.
 
Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks in the game average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.
 
Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if there are no characters in
in the area; less often (15 minutes) if any characters are present.  Also
note that objects lying on the ground will not be regenerated if anyone
is in the area when it resets.
 
Area resets are indicated by 'squeaking noises' just prior to the reset.
~

0 TIME~
Usage : time

	Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the output 
of this command may be one of surprise, but you will get used to it. You will
have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game depend on this
particular notion of time; the opening hours of the shops, for example.
The game operates on 24 hours days, 35 day months, and 17 month years.
If you want to know how fast hours are in realtime, time it yourself!
~

65 TIMECMD~
Syntax:  timecmd <command>
Example: timecmd mpstat <mob>
 
Returns the time required to execute the specified command for that
instance of its execution.
~

0 TITLE~
Usage : title <message>

	This command is best used for creativity and in EXPRESSING YOUR
CHARACTER! Whenever you use WHO, you see a level title, which tells you 
the player's approximate level and the player's title, after their name. 
(WHO tells you more interesting things, too!) This means that proper 
role-players would do something like :

title the Mordilnian Slasher
title the Human Hat-Rack                       <--- (at least he's honest)

	You may not change your title until you have earned the right.

0 TOPKILLS TOPDEATHS TOPRATIO~
Usage : topkills
        topdeaths
        topratio

	These three commands display lists of infamous PCs and their
accomplishments. Players with less than 10 kills are not on the topkills 
listing, player with 0 deaths are not on the topdeaths listing. Topratio
scores are computed according to (number of mobs player has killed) 
divided by (number of times player has died + 1).

	Certain kills don't count (i.e. slaying mobs which are *extremely*
puny compared to you). There's a sliding scale, so at higher levels, kills
that may have been counted before, will not be anymore.
~

0 TRACKING TRACK TRAIL~
Usage : track <player or mobile>
    
        Tracking a mob allows you to 'sniff' their trail out, based on clues
in your surroundings.  In MUD terms, you'll be told which direction to go   
to get to that person.  If you become an experienced tracker, you don't
even have to be close to your target to begin tracking it, but until then,
you must at least enter the same zone as your prey.

See Also: HUNT, MINOR TRACK, MAJOR TRACK
~

1 TRANCE~
THIS SPELL IS NOT AVAILABLE

Syntax:  trance
 
A character in possession of this skill may use it to briefly focus its
energies toward restoring a small burst of mana.
~

52 TRANSFER~
Syntax: transfer <character>
Syntax: transfer all
Syntax: transfer <character> <location>
Syntax: transfer all         <location>

TRANSFER transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location.

~

54 TRIGGER~
A trigger is an action, phrase, or game event that causes a program
held within a room, mob or object, to begin playing out its commands.
 
Triggers can be anything from a player or mob entering a room, to a
player stating a particular phrase within a room, or to a mob or an
object.
 
For detailed information on triggers, see:
 
RPTRIGGERS, MPTRIGGERS, OPTRIGGERS
~

0 TROLL TROLLS TROLLISH~
Trolls vary greatly in their physical appearance.  What they do all
seem to have in common is that they are quite strong, extremely hardy, and
have the ability to heal damage *very* quickly.  While not too smart, not too
wise, and not too quick, trolls are not so bad as people might think.  They
also have a religious bent, oddly enough.
~

0 'TROLLISH VIGOR' TROLLISH VIGOR~
This spell increases your stamina during its duration.
~

57 'TRUE SIGHT'~
Syntax:  cast 'true sight'
 
This spell can only be cast upon yourself.  It is a combination of
infravision (enabling you to see in the dark), detect invisible,
and detect hidden.  This spell also allows you to see through
blinding attacks.
~

1 TRUE TRUESIGHT~
Syntax:  cast truesight
Syntax:  c true
 
Truesight confers the caster with a very brief immunity to blindness
(from attacks such as gouge or the blindness spell itself).  While
under the spell's effect, the caster continues to see.  Be warned
that when the spell wears off the caster will become blind should
the effects of the blinding attack still remain.
Truesight cannot be cast on anyone but the caster itself.
~

65 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.

  Here we'd like to duplicate the original credits from the Basic Rules,

~

59 UNFOLDAREA~
Syntax: unfoldarea <area filename>

This command will load up an area file.

NOTE: It could be quite dangerous to unfold an area that is already loaded,
      or one that has not been tested.
~

61 UNUM UNUMS~
A UNUM is a unique number, assigned to an object or character upon it's
creation.  A UNUM is unique, and as such, you convienently access the same
object or mobile, without worrying about statting a different object or mob,
even though there may be many instances of it with the same vnum.
 
 
OWHERE and MWHERE will display the UNUM in the second column, and the vnum in
the third.  All normal commands will take UNUMs as arguments, simple prefix
the number with 'u', as in: ostat u232 or mstat u991
 
See Also: MWHERE, OWHERE
~

0 USE WANDS STAFFS~
Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

	Using staves will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, in some cases, or everyone not in your group in others. Therefore staves
are naturally very powerful, and yet may be very dangerous to use around other
players.
 
	Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either
a character or an object.

	Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or wand to
avoid confusion.

See Also: QUAFF, RECITE
~

54 USEPROG~
Syntax: opedit <object> <command> [number] [use_prog] [percentage]
 
The use_prog is an objtrigger that can be used in object programs.  The
use_prog will be executed when the item is used.  To define what will
trigger the use_prog, here is a list:

* Wands - when you zap
* Staves - when you brandish
* Food/pills - when you eat
* Blood/fountains/drink containers - when you drink
* Lights/armour/weapons - when you wear/wield/hold
* Potions - when you quaff
* Pipes - when you smoke
 
When the use_prog is executed you will not see the standard 'use message'
(ie You quaff a violet potion). What you will will be any mpechoes placed
in the program.  Also, any mobprog commands can be used in use_prog (see 
MPCOMMANDS).

**NOTE** The use_progs on lights, armour, and weapons are executed BEFORE
the player wears/holds/wields any item. Therefore, a mpforce to remove the
item will not work in the use_prog.  You will have to use a wear trigger
to accomplish this.
~

64 USERS~
Syntax: users <host ip>
Syntax: users <playername>

USERS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including users
in the process of logging in.
If used with an argument, it will show all users from that host ip.
Shortforms of host will work -- e.x. 205, or 205.113, etc.
Shortened names will also work.  e.x., users fre would show
Fredrick and Fred if they were on at the time.
The first number, (desc), is the descriptor number that this user is on.
The second number is the user's connected state.  (See CONSTATES)
The third number is the number of seconds the user has been idle.
The fourth number is the remote TCP port on the user's host machine.
Next is the user's character name, then the user's host address.
(Usually the IP number as name resolving is normally disabled.)

The FORCECLOSE command can be used to force a connect to close by its
descriptor number.
~

0 VALIANCE~
This spell increases your perserverence when you are on the verge of
losing consciousness.
~

0 VALUE~
Usage : value <object>

	Value tells you the value/vital stats of something. For example, value

0 VAMPIRE VAMPIRES~
Vampires are powerful beings which require copious quantities of fresh blood.
Here is a brief summary of how they compare to the other classes:
 
 - Vampires use blood points (bp) instead of mana for casting spells.
 - Blood points can be lost by taking large amounts of damage during battle.
 - Spare blood points can save a vampire during battle by providing a small
   burst of extra hit points (hp).
 - Vampires get a penalty to armor class during the day, and a bonus during
   the night.
 - Vampires may mist walk to their victims under cover of darkness.
