DOTD2 Intermud-3
----------------

As of Version 2.3.3, DOTD codebase has full I3 support already installed.
DO NOT add this code or you WILL break something. Leave now while you still can.

DOTD code release V2.3.2 has partial support for I3 in place.
All you'll need to do with that version is complete steps 1, 2, 9, 10 and 11 of the main
install instructions before returning to this file for completion.

Versions 2.3.1 and lower of DOTD code MUST complete the full install according to the
Smaug derivitive instructions before returning here.

In the comm.c install, the act_string section is not required.
The code already has it in place.

In i3cfg.h, in the #ifdef I3SMAUG section:

Find:
   #define I3ISINVIS(ch)	( (IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && xIS_SET( (ch)->act, PLR_WIZINVIS )) || I3INVIS(ch) == TRUE )
Replace with:
   #define I3ISINVIS(ch)	( (IS_IMMORTAL(ch) && (ch)->pcdata->wizinvis > 0) || I3INVIS(ch) == TRUE )

Find:
   #define I3NOTELL(ch) ( xIS_SET( (ch)->act, PLR_NO_TELL ) || IS_SET( (ch)->deaf, CHANNEL_TELLS ) )
Replace with:
   #define I3NOTELL(ch) ( IS_SET( (ch)->act, PLR_NO_TELL ) || IS_SET( (ch)->deaf, CHANNEL_TELLS ) )

Find:
   #define CH_CLASSNAME(ch)	(class_table[(ch)->class]->who_name)
Replace with:
   #define CH_CLASSNAME(ch)	(GetClassString(ch))

Find:
   #define CH_AFK(ch)		(xIS_SET((ch)->act, PLR_AFK))
Replace with:
   #define CH_AFK(ch)		(IS_SET((ch)->act, PLR_AFK))

Find:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)	((ch)->level)
Replace with:
   #define CH_LEVEL(ch)	GetMaxLevel((ch))
