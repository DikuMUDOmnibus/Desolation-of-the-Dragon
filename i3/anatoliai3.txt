Anatolia 2.1 Intermud-3
-----------------------

In comm.c, when looking for act_new, your looking for act_color instead.
Placement of the code is still the same.

In i3cfg.h, in the #ifdef I3ROM section:

Find:
   #define CH_CLAN(ch)		((ch)->clan)
   #define CH_CLANNAME(ch)	(clan_table[(ch)->clan].who_name)
Replace with:
   #define CH_CLAN(ch)		( 0 == 1 )
   #define CH_CLANNAME(ch)	( "" )

Anatolia does not appear to come with clan support.
