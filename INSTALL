Installing:

1.  Uncompress the package

2.  cd into the dotd-x.x.x directory.

3.  Run: ./configure
	If you know what you're doing (ie you've seen a configure script
	before) --help will list some things you can customize

4.  Run: make

If there are no errors the code should be compiled.

To run the mud for the first time, to see if it runs properly:

5.  Run: cd area

6.  Run: ../src/dotd -v

The mud will log it's output and if it says 'Ready to run' everything
should be good to go.  You can now 'Ctrl+C' it and run it through the
normal startup script:

7.  Run: cd ../src

8.  Run: nohup ./startup &


The configure script has been tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris but
close variants should work.  If you get errors compiling, contact
dotd@dotd.com.
